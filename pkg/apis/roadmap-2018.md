# 2018 API Core Roadmap

The purpose of the API Core group is to implement the control plane API for the
Knative Serving project. This includes the API governance process as well as
implementation and supporting documentation.

This roadmap is what we hope to accomplish in 2018.

## References

- [Resource Overview](../../docs/spec/overview.md)
- [Conformance Tests](../../test/conformance/README.md)

In 2018, we will largely focus on curating and implementing the Knative Serving
resource specification.

## Areas of Interest and Requirements

1. **Process**. It must be clear to contributors how to drive changes to the
   Knative Serving API.
1. **Schema**. [The Knative Serving API schema](../../docs/spec/spec.md) matches
   [our implementation.](./serving/).
1. **Semantics**. The [semantics](../controller/) of Knative Serving API
   interactions match
   [our specification](../../docs/spec/normative_examples.md), and are well
   covered by [conformance testing](../../test/conformance/README.md).

<!-- TODO(mattmoor): Should this cover Infrastructure as well? -->

### Process

1. **Define the process** by which changes to the API are proposed, approved,
   and implemented.
1. **Define our conventions** to which API changes should adhere for consistency
   with the Knative Serving API.

### Specification

1. **Complete our implementation** of the initial API specification.

1. **Track changes** to our API specification (according to our process) over
   time, including the versioning of API resources.

1. **Triage drift** of our implementation from the API specification.

<!-- TODO(mattmoor): Should this include something about webhook validation? -->

### Semantics

1. **Implement our desired semantics** as outlined in our
   ["normative examples"](../../docs/spec/normative_examples.md).

1. **Fail gracefully and clearly** as outlined in our
   ["errors conditions and reporting"](../../docs/spec/errors.md) docs.

   <!-- TODO(mattmoor): https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/459 -->

1. **Ensure continued conformance** of our implementation with the API
   specification over time by ensuring semantics are well covered by our
   conformance testing.

   <!-- TODO(mattmoor): https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/234 -->
   <!-- TODO(mattmoor): https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/492 -->

1. **Operator Extensions**. Guidelines for how operators can/should customize an
   Knative Serving installation (e.g. runtime contract) are captured in
   documentation.
