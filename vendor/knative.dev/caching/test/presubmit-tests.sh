# This script runs the presubmit tests; it is started by prow for each PR.
# For convenience, it can also be executed manually.
# Running the script without parameters, or with the --all-tests
# flag, causes all tests to be executed, in the right order.
# Use the flags --build-tests, --unit-tests and --integration-tests
# to run a specific set of tests.
