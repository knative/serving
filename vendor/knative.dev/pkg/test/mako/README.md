# Mako

[Mako](https://github.com/google/mako) is an open source project for performance testing in Knative.
It offers capacities like data storage, charting, statistical aggregation and automated regression analysis.

This folder contains common code that can be used by all Knative projects, with which we can follow the
same process to set up Mako and collaborate.
