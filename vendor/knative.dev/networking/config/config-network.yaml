    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # ingress.class specifies the default ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the Ingress class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    ingress.class: "istio.ingress.networking.knative.dev"

    # certificate.class specifies the default Certificate class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Cert-Manager Certificate.
    #
    # Note that changing the Certificate class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    certificate.class: "cert-manager.certificate.networking.knative.dev"

    # domainTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the Knative service's DNS name. The default
    # value is "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}".
    #
    # Valid variables defined in the template include Name, Namespace, Domain,
    # Labels, and Annotations. Name will be the result of the tagTemplate
    # below, if a tag is specified for the route.
    #
    # Changing this value might be necessary when the extra levels in
    # the domain name generated is problematic for wildcard certificates
    # that only support a single level of domain name added to the
    # certificate's domain. In those cases you might consider using a value
    # of "{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}", or removing the Namespace
    # entirely from the template. When choosing a new value be thoughtful
    # of the potential for conflicts - for example, when users choose to use
    # characters such as `-` in their service, or namespace, names.
    # {{.Annotations}} or {{.Labels}} can be used for any customization in the
    # go template if needed.
    # We strongly recommend keeping namespace part of the template to avoid
    # domain name clashes:
    # eg. '{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{ index .Annotations "sub"}}.{{.Domain}}'
    # and you have an annotation {"sub":"foo"}, then the generated template
    # would be {Name}-{Namespace}.foo.{Domain}
    domainTemplate: "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"

    # tagTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the DNS name for "tags" within the traffic blocks
    # of Routes and Configuration.  This is used in conjunction with the
    # domainTemplate above to determine the full URL for the tag.
    tagTemplate: "{{.Tag}}-{{.Name}}"

    # Controls whether TLS certificates are automatically provisioned and
    # installed in the Knative ingress to terminate external TLS connection.
    # 1. Enabled: enabling auto-TLS feature.
    # 2. Disabled: disabling auto-TLS feature.
    autoTLS: "Disabled"

    # Controls the behavior of the HTTP endpoint for the Knative ingress.
    # It requires autoTLS to be enabled.
    # 1. Enabled: The Knative ingress will be able to serve HTTP connection.
    # 2. Disabled: The Knative ingress will reject HTTP traffic.
    # 3. Redirected: The Knative ingress will send a 301 redirect for all
    # http connections, asking the clients to use HTTPS.
    httpProtocol: "Enabled"

    # rolloutDuration contains the minimal duration in seconds over which the
    # Configuration traffic targets are rolled out to the newest revision.
    rolloutDuration: "0"

    # autocreateClusterDomainClaims controls whether ClusterDomainClaims should
    # be automatically created (and deleted) as needed when DomainMappings are
    # reconciled.
    #
    # If this is "false", the cluster administrator is responsible for creating
    # ClusterDomainClaims and delegating them to namespaces via their
    # spec.Namespace field. This is useful for multitenant environments
    # which need to control which namespace can use a particular domain name in
    # a domain mapping.
    autocreateClusterDomainClaims: "true"

    # If true, networking plugins can add additional information to deployed
    # applications to make their pods directly accessible via their IPs even if mesh is
    # enabled and thus direct-addressability is usually not possible.
    # Consumers like Knative Serving can use this setting to adjust their behavior
    # accordingly, i.e. to drop fallback solutions for non-pod-addressable systems.
    #
    # NOTE: This flag is in an alpha state and is mostly here to enable internal testing
    #       for now. Use with caution.
    enable-mesh-pod-addressability: "false"

    # If set, overrides the scheme used for external URLs.
    # This can be used for making Knative report all URLs as "HTTPS" for example, if you're
    # fronting Knative with an external loadbalancer that deals with TLS termination and
    # Knative doesn't know about that otherwise.
