/*
Package model contains the Zipkin V2 model which is used by the Zipkin Go
tracer implementation.

Third party instrumentation libraries can use the model and transport packages
found in this Zipkin Go library to directly interface with the Zipkin Server or
Zipkin Collectors without the need to use the tracer implementation itself.
