# Helper scripts

This directory contains helper scripts used by Prow test jobs, as well and local
development scripts.

## Using the `presubmit-tests.sh` helper script

This is a helper script to run the presubmit tests. To use it:

1. Source this script.

1. [optional] Define the function `build_tests()`. If you don't define this
   function, the default action for running the build tests is to:

   - check markdown files
   - run `go build` on the entire repo
   - run `/hack/verify-codegen.sh` (if it exists)
   - check licenses in all go packages

   The markdown link checker tool doesn't check `localhost` links by default.
   Its configuration file, `markdown-link-check-config.json`, lives in the
   `test-infra/scripts` directory. To override it, create a file with the same
   name, containing the custom config in the `/test` directory.

   The markdown lint tool ignores long lines by default. Its configuration file,
   `markdown-lint-config.rc`, lives in the `test-infra/scripts` directory. To
   override it, create a file with the same name, containing the custom config
   in the `/test` directory.

1. [optional] Customize the default build test runner, if you're using it. Set
   the following environment variables if the default values don't fit your
   needs:

   - `DISABLE_MD_LINTING`: Disable linting markdown files, defaults to 0
     (false).
   - `DISABLE_MD_LINK_CHECK`: Disable checking links in markdown files, defaults
     to 0 (false).
   - `PRESUBMIT_TEST_FAIL_FAST`: Fail the presubmit test immediately if a test
     fails, defaults to 0 (false).

1. [optional] Define the functions `pre_build_tests()` and/or
   `post_build_tests()`. These functions will be called before or after the
   build tests (either your custom one or the default action) and will cause the
   test to fail if they don't return success.

1. [optional] Define the function `unit_tests()`. If you don't define this
   function, the default action for running the unit tests is to run all go
   tests in the repo.

1. [optional] Define the functions `pre_unit_tests()` and/or
   `post_unit_tests()`. These functions will be called before or after the unit
   tests (either your custom one or the default action) and will cause the test
   to fail if they don't return success.

1. [optional] Define the function `integration_tests()`. If you don't define
   this function, the default action for running the integration tests is to run
   all run all `./test/e2e-*tests.sh` scripts, in sequence.

1. [optional] Define the functions `pre_integration_tests()` and/or
   `post_integration_tests()`. These functions will be called before or after
   the integration tests (either your custom one or the default action) and will
   cause the test to fail if they don't return success.

1. Call the `main()` function passing `$@` (without quotes).

Running the script without parameters, or with the `--all-tests` flag causes all
tests to be executed, in the right order (i.e., build, then unit, then
integration tests).

Use the flags `--build-tests`, `--unit-tests` and `--integration-tests` to run a
specific set of tests. The flag `--emit-metrics` is used to emit metrics when
running the tests, and is automatically handled by the default action for
integration tests (see above).

The script will automatically skip all presubmit tests for PRs where all changed
files are exempt of tests (e.g., a PR changing only the `OWNERS` file).

Also, for PRs touching only markdown files, the unit and integration tests are
skipped.

### Sample presubmit test script

```bash
source vendor/github.com/knative/test-infra/scripts/presubmit-tests.sh

function post_build_tests() {
  echo "Cleaning up after build tests"
  rm -fr ./build-cache
}

function unit_tests() {
  make -C tests test
}

function pre_integration_tests() {
  echo "Cleaning up before integration tests"
  rm -fr ./staging-area
}

# We use the default integration test runner.

main $@
```

## Using the `e2e-tests.sh` helper script

This is a helper script for Knative E2E test scripts. To use it:

1. [optional] Customize the test cluster. Set the following environment
   variables if the default values don't fit your needs:

   - `E2E_CLUSTER_REGION`: Cluster region, defaults to `us-central1`.
   - `E2E_CLUSTER_BACKUP_REGIONS`: Space-separated list of regions to retry test
     cluster creation in case of stockout. Defaults to `us-west1 us-east1`.
   - `E2E_CLUSTER_ZONE`: Cluster zone (e.g., `a`), defaults to none (i.e. use a
     regional cluster).
   - `E2E_CLUSTER_BACKUP_ZONES`: Space-separated list of zones to retry test
     cluster creation in case of stockout. If defined,
     `E2E_CLUSTER_BACKUP_REGIONS` will be ignored thus it defaults to none.
   - `E2E_CLUSTER_MACHINE`: Cluster node machine type, defaults to
     `n1-standard-4}`.
   - `E2E_MIN_CLUSTER_NODES`: Minimum number of nodes in the cluster when
     autoscaling, defaults to 1.
   - `E2E_MAX_CLUSTER_NODES`: Maximum number of nodes in the cluster when
     autoscaling, defaults to 3.

1. Source the script.

1. [optional] Write the `knative_setup()` function, which will set up your
   system under test (e.g., Knative Serving). This function won't be called if
   you use the `--skip-knative-setup` flag.

1. [optional] Write the `knative_teardown()` function, which will tear down your
   system under test (e.g., Knative Serving). This function won't be called if
   you use the `--skip-knative-setup` flag.

1. [optional] Write the `test_setup()` function, which will set up the test
   resources.

1. [optional] Write the `test_teardown()` function, which will tear down the
   test resources.

1. [optional] Write the `cluster_setup()` function, which will set up any
   resources before the test cluster is created.

1. [optional] Write the `cluster_teardown()` function, which will tear down any
   resources after the test cluster is destroyed.

1. [optional] Write the `dump_extra_cluster_state()` function. It will be called
   when a test fails, and can dump extra information about the current state of
   the cluster (typically using `kubectl`).

1. [optional] Write the `parse_flags()` function. It will be called whenever an
   unrecognized flag is passed to the script, allowing you to define your own
   flags. The function must return 0 if the flag is unrecognized, or the number
   of items to skip in the command line if the flag was parsed successfully. For
   example, return 1 for a simple flag, and 2 for a flag with a parameter.

1. Call the `initialize()` function passing `$@` (without quotes).

1. Write logic for the end-to-end tests. Run all go tests using `go_test_e2e()`
   (or `report_go_test()` if you need a more fine-grained control) and call
   `fail_test()` or `success()` if any of them failed. The environment variable
   `KO_DOCKER_REPO` and `E2E_PROJECT_ID` will be set according to the test
   cluster. You can also use the following boolean (0 is false, 1 is true)
   environment variables for the logic:

   - `EMIT_METRICS`: true if `--emit-metrics` was passed.

   All environment variables above are marked read-only.

**Notes:**

1. Calling your script without arguments will create a new cluster in the GCP
   project `$PROJECT_ID` and run the tests against it.

1. Calling your script with `--run-tests` and the variable `KO_DOCKER_REPO` set
   will immediately start the tests against the cluster currently configured for
   `kubectl`.

1. By default Istio is installed on the cluster via Addon, use
   `--skip-istio-addon` if you choose not to have it preinstalled.

1. You can force running the tests against a specific GKE cluster version by
   using the `--cluster-version` flag and passing a full version as the flag
   value.

### Sample end-to-end test script

This script will test that the latest Knative Serving nightly release works. It
defines a special flag (`--no-knative-wait`) that causes the script not to wait
for Knative Serving to be up before running the tests. It also requires that the
test cluster is created in a specific region, `us-west2`.

```bash

# This test requires a cluster in LA
E2E_CLUSTER_REGION=us-west2

source vendor/github.com/knative/test-infra/scripts/e2e-tests.sh

function knative_setup() {
  start_latest_knative_serving
  if (( WAIT_FOR_KNATIVE )); then
    wait_until_pods_running knative-serving || fail_test "Knative Serving not up"
  fi
}

function parse_flags() {
  if [[ "$1" == "--no-knative-wait" ]]; then
    WAIT_FOR_KNATIVE=0
    return 1
  fi
  return 0
}

WAIT_FOR_KNATIVE=1

initialize $@

# TODO: use go_test_e2e to run the tests.
kubectl get pods || fail_test

success
```

## Using the `release.sh` helper script

This is a helper script for Knative release scripts. To use it:

1. Source the script.

1. [optional] By default, the release script will run
   `./test/presubmit-tests.sh` as the release validation tests. If you need to
   run something else, set the environment variable `VALIDATION_TESTS` to the
   executable to run.

1. Write logic for building the release in a function named `build_release()`.
   Set the environment variable `ARTIFACTS_TO_PUBLISH` to the list of files
   created, space separated. Use the following boolean (0 is false, 1 is true)
   and string environment variables for the logic:

   - `RELEASE_VERSION`: contains the release version if `--version` was passed.
     This also overrides the value of the `TAG` variable as `v<version>`.
   - `RELEASE_BRANCH`: contains the release branch if `--branch` was passed.
     Otherwise it's empty and `master` HEAD will be considered the release
     branch.
   - `RELEASE_NOTES`: contains the filename with the release notes if
     `--release-notes` was passed. The release notes is a simple markdown file.
   - `RELEASE_GCS_BUCKET`: contains the GCS bucket name to store the manifests
     if `--release-gcs` was passed, otherwise the default value
     `knative-nightly/<repo>` will be used. It is empty if `--publish` was not
     passed.
   - `BUILD_COMMIT_HASH`: the commit short hash for the current repo. If the
     current git tree is dirty, it will have `-dirty` appended to it.
   - `BUILD_YYYYMMDD`: current UTC date in `YYYYMMDD` format.
   - `BUILD_TIMESTAMP`: human-readable UTC timestamp in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS`
     format.
   - `BUILD_TAG`: a tag in the form `v$BUILD_YYYYMMDD-$BUILD_COMMIT_HASH`.
   - `KO_DOCKER_REPO`: contains the GCR to store the images if `--release-gcr`
     was passed, otherwise the default value `gcr.io/knative-nightly` will be
     used. It is set to `ko.local` if `--publish` was not passed.
   - `SKIP_TESTS`: true if `--skip-tests` was passed. This is handled
     automatically.
   - `TAG_RELEASE`: true if `--tag-release` was passed. In this case, the
     environment variable `TAG` will contain the release tag in the form
     `v$BUILD_TAG`.
   - `PUBLISH_RELEASE`: true if `--publish` was passed. In this case, the
     environment variable `KO_FLAGS` will be updated with the `-L` option and
     `TAG` will contain the release tag in the form `v$RELEASE_VERSION`.
   - `PUBLISH_TO_GITHUB`: true if `--version`, `--branch` and
     `--publish-release` were passed.

   All boolean environment variables default to false for safety.

   All environment variables above, except `KO_FLAGS`, are marked read-only once
   `main()` is called (see below).

1. Call the `main()` function passing `$@` (without quotes).

### Sample release script

```bash
source vendor/github.com/knative/test-infra/scripts/release.sh

function build_release() {
  # config/ contains the manifests
  ko resolve ${KO_FLAGS} -f config/ > release.yaml
  ARTIFACTS_TO_PUBLISH="release.yaml"
}

main $@
```
