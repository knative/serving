## Introduction

Istio is an open platform for providing a uniform way to integrate
microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices, enforce policies
and aggregate telemetry data. Istio's control plane provides an abstraction
layer over the underlying cluster management platform, such as Kubernetes,
Mesos, etc.

Visit [istio.io](https://istio.io) for in-depth information about using Istio.     

## Istio authors

Istio is an open source project with an active development community. The project was started
by teams from Google and IBM, in partnership with the Envoy team at Lyft.

## Community meeting

We have [PUBLIC](https://zoom.us/j/986657835) and [RECORDED](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-zVlo1F3mUbExQ96fABWcQ) bi-weekly community meetings every other Thursday at 11am US Pacific Time. Meeting agendas and notes can be accessed in the [working doc](http://bit.ly/istiocommunitymeet). 

Map that to your local time with this [timezone table](https://www.google.com/search?q=1100+am+in+pst).

## How can I help ?

See our [community page](https://istio.io/community) for ways to get involved
in our community.

To dig deeper, check the [architecture](https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/overview.html#architecture)
and read some [design docs](./CONTRIBUTING.md#design-documents).

If you're looking for something to do to get your feet wet working on Istio, look for GitHub issues
marked with the Help Wanted label:

- [Primary Istio repo](https://github.com/istio/istio/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22community%2Fhelp+wanted%22)
- [Documentation repo](https://github.com/istio/istio.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)

Of course, even if there's not an issue opened for it, we can always use more
testing throughout the platform. Similarly, we can always use more docs, richer docs,
insightful docs. Or maybe a cool blog post?
And if you're a web developer, we could use your help in spiffing up our public-facing web site.

## Questions and issues
