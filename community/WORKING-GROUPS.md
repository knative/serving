# Elafros Working Groups

Most community activity is organized into *working groups*.

Working groups follow the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines although
each of these groups may operate a little differently depending on their needs
and workflow.

When the need arises, a new working group can be created. See the [working group
processes](WORKING-GROUP-PROCESSES.md) for working group proposal and creation
procedures.

The working groups generate design docs which are kept in a [shared drive](TODO)
and are available for anyone to read. You have to request access to the drive,
something we're stuck with sadly, but once you do you'll have access to all the
docs and won't need to request access for each of them individually.

The current working groups are:

* [Build & deploy](#build-deploy)
* [Events](#events)
* [Scaling](#scaling)
* [Serving](#serving)
