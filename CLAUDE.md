## Key Technical Decisions

### Pod State Management

The fork implements a sophisticated pod state machine with six states:

- `podHealthy (0)`: Pod is healthy and serving traffic normally
- `podDraining (1)`: Pod is being removed from service, draining active requests
- `podQuarantined (2)`: Pod failed health check, in timed backoff period
- `podRecovering (3)`: Post-quarantine probation, needs one successful request to be trusted again
- `podRemoved (4)`: Pod completely removed from tracker (terminal state)
- `podPending (5)`: Brand new pod, not yet health-checked

#### Complete State Transition Map

**Initial State:**
```
NEW POD ‚Üí podPending (until first health check)
```

**From podPending (brand new pods):**
- ‚úÖ Health check passes ‚Üí `podHealthy`
- ‚ùå 1st health check fails ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (0s backoff - immediate retry)
- ‚ùå 2nd failure ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (1s backoff)
- ‚ùå 3rd failure ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (1s backoff)
- ‚ùå 4th failure ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (2s backoff)
- ‚ùå 5+ failures ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (5s backoff, capped)
- üóëÔ∏è Removed from endpoints ‚Üí `podRemoved`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Endpoint update ‚Üí STAYS `podPending` (no disruption)

**From podHealthy (established healthy pods):**
- ‚ùå Health check fails ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (conservative backoff: 1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 20s)
- üóëÔ∏è Removed from endpoints ‚Üí `podDraining` ‚Üí `podRemoved`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Endpoint update ‚Üí STAYS `podHealthy` (no action needed)

**From podQuarantined (in backoff period):**
- ‚è±Ô∏è Quarantine timer expires ‚Üí `podRecovering`
- üóëÔ∏è Removed from endpoints ‚Üí `podRemoved`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Endpoint update ‚Üí STAYS `podQuarantined` (respects backoff timer)

**From podRecovering (probation state):**
- ‚úÖ Successful request served ‚Üí `podHealthy` (clears quarantine count)
- ‚ùå Health check fails ‚Üí `podQuarantined` (appropriate backoff based on history)
- üóëÔ∏è Removed from endpoints ‚Üí `podDraining` ‚Üí `podRemoved`
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Endpoint update ‚Üí STAYS `podRecovering` (no disruption)

**From podDraining (graceful shutdown):**
- ‚è±Ô∏è RefCount reaches 0 ‚Üí `podRemoved`
- ‚è±Ô∏è Stuck for maxDrainingDuration ‚Üí `podRemoved` (force remove)
- üîÑ Re-added to endpoints ‚Üí `podPending` (re-validate before trusting)

**From podRemoved (terminal state):**
- üîÑ Re-added to endpoints ‚Üí `podPending` (treat as new pod)

**Critical Invariants:**
- Quarantine backoff is never short-circuited by endpoint updates
- Recovering pods must serve one successful request before becoming healthy
- Pending pods always get health-checked before accepting traffic
- Only atomic CAS operations for critical state transitions
- Quarantine metrics properly incremented/decremented
- Endpoint updates respect in-progress recovery mechanisms

### Quarantine System

- Pods failing health checks are quarantined with exponential backoff
- Automatic recovery with health verification
- Maximum quarantine count before permanent eviction

### Capacity Calculation

- Tracks "effective capacity" considering pod health states
- Prevents capacity starvation from unhealthy pods
- Dynamic adjustment based on real-time health metrics

## Known Issues & TODOs

See `ACTIVATOR_FIXES.md` for detailed list of known issues including:

1. Error handling in ServeHTTP needs improvement
2. Quarantine recovery mechanism requires health verification
3. Race condition in resetTrackers() method
4. Need for pod eviction after persistent quarantines
5. ErrRequestQueueFull investigation needed

## Testing Considerations

When making changes:

1. Run unit tests with race detection: `go test -race`
2. Test pod health transitions under load
3. Verify metrics are correctly reported
4. Check WebSocket compatibility if modifying proxy code
5. Ensure error propagation works end-to-end
