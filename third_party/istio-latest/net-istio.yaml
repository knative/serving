    # It is the new and preferred way to define the configuration.

    #     namespace: {{gateway_namespace}}

    #
    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any
    # sidecar injection (like Knative's istio-ci-no-mesh.yaml). Since every pod
    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local service
    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
