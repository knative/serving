    # A cluster local gateway to allow pods outside of the mesh to access
    # Services and Routes not exposing through an ingress.  If the users
    # do have a service mesh setup, this isn't required and can be removed.
    #
    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any
    # sidecar injection (like Knative's istio-ci-no-mesh.yaml).  Since every pod
    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local  service
    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
    # The configuration format should be `local-gateway.{{local_gateway_namespace}}.
    # {{local_gateway_name}}: "{{cluster_local_gateway_name}}.
    # {{cluster_local_gateway_namespace}}.svc.cluster.local"`. The
