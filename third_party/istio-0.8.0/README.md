This istio.yaml file is is generated by running
```
./download-istio.sh
```

Followed by:
(1) adding the `istio-system` namespace (see PATCH #1 in the file), and
(2) adding a Prestop sleep in the sidecar proxy, so that the proxy stays up a
    little bit longer after Pod is being removed (see PATCH #2 in the file).
