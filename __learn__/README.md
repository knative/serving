Knative Serving extends Kubernetes by enabling the convenient and scaleable deployment of apps and functions as serverless containers. It achieves this purpose by making available middleware components that make it possible to quickly deploy such containers, autoscaling up and down (to even zero), routing & network configuration, and point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations

Detailed [Knative Serving docs](https://www.knative.dev/docs/serving) are available.
If you are searching for [the Knative Serving specs](https://github.com/knative/serving/tree/main/docs), they are also available.

[Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [development](./DEVELOPMENT.md) info is also available.
