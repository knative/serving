# Sample API Usage

Following are several normative sample scenarios utilizing the Elafros
API. These scenarios are arranged to provide a flavor of the API and
building from the smallest, most frequent operations.

Examples in this section illustrate:

* [Automatic rollout of a new Revision to an existing Service with a
  pre-built container](#1-automatic-rollout-of-a-new-revision-to-existing-service---pre-built-container)
* [Creating a first route to deploy a first revision from a pre-built
  container](#2-creating-route-and-deploying-first-revision---pre-built-container)
* [Configuration changes and manual rollout
  options](#3-manual-rollout-of-a-new-revision---config-change-only)
* [Creating a revision from source](#4-deploy-a-revision-from-source)
* [Creating a function from source](#5-deploy-a-function)

Note that these API operations are identical for both app and function
based services. (to see the full resource definitions, see the
[Resource YAML Definitions](spec.md)).

CLI samples are for illustrative purposes, and not intended to
represent final CLI design.

## 1) Automatic rollout of a new Revision to existing Service - pre-built container

**_Scenario_**: User deploys a new revision to an existing service
with a new container image, rolling out automatically to 100%

```
$ elafros deploy --service my-service
  Deploying app to service [my-service]:
✓ Starting
✓ Promoting
  Done.
  Deployed to https://my-service.default.mydomain.com
```

**Steps**:

* Update the Configuration with the config change

**Results:**

* A new Revision is created, and automatically rolled out to 100% once
  ready

![Automatic Rollout](images/auto_rollout.png)


After the initial Route and Configuration have been created (which is
shown in the [second example](TODO)), the typical
interaction is to update the revision configuration, resulting in the
creation of a new revision, which will be automatically rolled out by
the route. Revision configuration updates can be handled as either a
PUT or PATCH operation:

* Optimistic concurrency controls for PUT operations in a
  read/modify/write routine work as expected in kubernetes.

* PATCH semantics should work as expected in kubernetes, but may have
  some limitations imposed by CRDs at the moment.

In this and following examples PATCH is used. Revisions can be built
from source, which results in a container image, or by directly
supplying a pre-built container, which this first scenario
illustrates. The example demonstrates the PATCH issued by the client,
followed by several GET calls to illustrate each step in the
reconciliation process as the system materializes the new revision,
and begins shifting traffic from the old revision to the new revision.

The client PATCHes the configuration's template revision with just the
new container image, inheriting previous configuration from the
configuration:

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service  # by convention, same name as the service
spec:
  revisionTemplate:  # template for building Revision
    spec:
      container:
        image: gcr.io/...  # new image
```

The update to the Configuration triggers a new revision being created,
and the Configuration is updated to reflect the new Revision:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service
  generation: 1235
 ...

spec: 
  ... # same as before, except new container.image
status:
  latestReadyRevisionName: abc
  latestCreatedRevisionName: def # new revision created, but not ready yet
  observedGeneration: 1235
```

The newly created revision has the same config as the previous
revision, but different code. Note the generation label reflects the
new generation of the configuration (1235), indicating the provenance
of the revision:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/revisions/def
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Revision
metadata:
  name: def
  labels:
    elafros.dev/configuration: my-service
  annotations:
    elafros.dev/configurationGeneration: 1235
  ...
spec:
  container:  # k8s core.v1.Container
    image: gcr.io/...  # new container
    # same config as previous revision
    env:
    - name: FOO
      value: bar
    - name: HELLO
      value: blurg
  ...
status:
  conditions:
   - type: Ready
     status: True
```

When the new revision is Ready, i.e. underlying resources are
materialized and ready to serve, the configuration updates its
`status.latestReadyRevisionName` status to reflect the new
revision. The route, which is configured to automatically rollout new
revisions from the configuration, watches the configuration and is
notified of the `latestReadyRevisionName`, and begins migrating traffic
to it. During reconciliation, traffic may be routed to both existing
revision `abc` and new revision `def`:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  ...
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - configurationName: my-service
      percent: 100

status:
  # domain:
  # oss: my-service.namespace.mydomain.com 
  domain: my-service.namespace.mydomain.com
  # percentages add to 100
  traffic:  # in status, all configurationName refs are dereferenced
  - revisionName: abc
    percent: 75
  - revisionName: def
    percent: 25
  conditions:
  - type: RolloutComplete
    status: False
```

And once reconciled, revision def serves 100% of the traffic :

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  ...
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - configurationName: my-service
      percent: 100
status:
  domain: my-service.default.mydomain.com
  traffic: 
  - revisionName: def
    percent: 100
  conditions:
  - type: RolloutComplete
    status: True
  ...
```


## 2) Creating Route and deploying first Revision - pre-built container

**Scenario**: User creates a new Route and deploys their first
  Revision based on a pre-built container

```
$ elafros deploy --service my-service --region us-central1
✓ Creating service [my-service] in region [us-central1]
  Deploying app to service [my-service]:
✓ Uploading     [=================]
✓ Starting
✓ Promoting
  Done.
  Deployed to https://my-service.default.mydomain.com
```

**Steps**:

* Create a new Configuration and a Route that references a that
  configuration.

**Results**:

* A new Configuration is created, and generates a new Revision based
  on the configuration

* A new Route is created, referencing the configuration

* The route begins serving traffic to the revision that was created by
  the configuration

![Initial Creation](images/initial_creation.png)


The previous example assumed an existing Route and Configuration to
illustrate the common scenario of updating the configuration to deploy
a new revision to the service.

In this getting started example, deploying a first Revision is
accomplished by creating a new Configuration (which will generate a
new Revision) and creating a new Route referring to that
configuration. Note that these two steps can occur in either order, or
in parallel.

A Route can either refer directly to a Revision, or to the latest
ready revision of a Configuration, as this example illustrates. This
is the most straightforward scenario that many Elafros customers are
expected to use, and is consistent with the experience of deploying
code that is rolled out immediately.

The example shows the POST calls issued by the client, followed by
several GET calls to illustrate each step in the reconciliation
process as the system materializes and begins routing traffic to the
revision.

The client creates the route and configuration, which by convention
share the same name:

```http
POST /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - configurationName: my-service  # named reference to Configuration
      percent: 100  # automatically activate new Revisions from the configuration
```

```http
POST /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service  # By convention (not req'd), same name as the service.
                    # This will also be set as the "elafros.dev/configuration"
                    # label on the created Revision.
spec:
  revisionTemplate:  # template for building Revision
    metadata: ...
    spec: 
      container: # k8s core.v1.Container
        image: gcr.io/...
        env:
        - name: FOO
          value: bar
        - name: HELLO
          value: world
      ...
```

Upon the creation of the configuration, the system will create a new
Revision, generating its name, and applying the spec and metadata from
the configuration, as well as new metadata labels:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/revisions/abc
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Revision
metadata:
  name: abc  # generated name
  labels:
    # name and generation of the configuration that created the revision
    elafros.dev/configuration: my-service
  annotations:
    elafros.dev/configurationGeneration: 1234
  ...  # uid, resourceVersion, creationTimestamp, generation, selfLink, etc
spec:
  ...  # spec from the configuration
status:
  conditions:
   - type: Ready
     status: False
     message: "Starting Instances"
```

Immediately after the revision is created, i.e. before underlying
resources have been fully materialized, the configuration is updated
with latestCreatedRevisionName:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service
  generation: 1234
  ...  # uid, resourceVersion, creationTimestamp, selfLink, etc
spec:
  ...  # same as before
status:
  # latest created revision, may not have materialized yet
  latestCreatedRevisionName: abc
  observedGeneration: 1234
```

The configuration watches the revision, and when the revision is
updated as Ready (to serve), the latestReadyRevisionName is updated:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service
  generation: 1234
  ...
spec: 
  ...  # same as before
status:
  # the latest created and ready to serve. Watched by service
  latestReadyRevisionName: abc
  # latest created revision 
  latestCreatedRevisionName: abc
  observedGeneration: 1234
```

The route, which watches the configuration `my-service`, observes the
change to `latestReadyRevisionName` and begins routing traffic to the
new revision `abc`, addressable as
`my-service.default.mydomain.com`. Once reconciled:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  generation: 2145
  ...
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - configurationName: my-service
      percent: 100

status:
  domain: my-service.default.mydomain.com

  traffic:  # in status, all configurationName refs are dereferenced to latest revision
  - revisionName: abc  # latestReadyRevisionName from configurationName in spec
    percent: 100

  conditions:
  - type: RolloutComplete
    status: True

  observedGeneration: 2145
```


## 3) Manual rollout of a new Revision - config change only

**_Scenario_**: User updates configuration with new configuration (env
  var change) to an existing service, tests the revision, then
  proceeds with a manually controlled rollout to 100%

```
$ elafros rollout strategy manual

$ elafros deploy --service my-service --env HELLO="blurg"
[...]

$ elafros revisions list --service my-service
Name    Traffic  Id   Date                Deployer     Git SHA
next     0%      v3   2018-01-19 12:16    user1        a6f92d1
current  100%    v2   2018-01-18 20:34    user1        a6f92d1
                 v1   2018-01-17 10:32    user1        33643fc

$ elafros rollout next percent 5
[...]
$ elafros rollout next percent 50
[...]
$ elafros rollout finish
[...]

$ elafros revisions list --service my-service
Name          Traffic  Id   Date                Deployer      Git SHA
current,next  100%     v3   2018-01-19 12:16    user1         a6f92d1
                       v2   2018-01-18 20:34    user1         a6f92d1
                       v1   2018-01-17 10:32    user1         33643fc
```

**Steps**:

* Update the Route to pin the current revision

* Update the Configuration with the new configuration (env var)

* Update the Route to address the new Revision 

* After testing the new revision through the named subdomain, proceed
  with the rollout, incrementally increasing traffic to 100%

**Results:**

* The system creates the new revision from the configuration,
  addressable at next.my-service... (by convention), but traffic is
  not routed to it until the percentage is manually ramped up. Upon
  completing the rollout, the next revision is now the current
  revision

![Manual rollout](images/manual_rollout.png)


In the previous examples, the route referenced a Configuration for
automatic rollouts of new Revisions. While this pattern is useful for
many scenarios such as functions-as-a-service and simple development
flows, the Route can also reference Revisions directly to "pin"
traffic to specific revisions, which is suitable for manually
controlling rollouts, i.e. testing a new revision prior to serving
traffic. (Note: see [Appendix B](complex_examples.md) for a
semi-automatic variation of manual rollouts).

The client updates the route to pin the current revision:

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - revisionName: def # pin a specific revision, i.e. the current one
      percent: 100
```

As in the previous example, the configuration is updated to trigger
the creation of a new revision, in this case updating the container
image but keeping the same config:

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  revisionTemplate:
    spec:
      container:
        env: # k8s-style strategic merge patch, updating a single list value
        - name: HELLO
          value: blurg # changed value
```

A new revision `ghi` is created that has the same code as the previous
revision `def`, but different config:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/revisions/ghi
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Revision
metadata:
  name: ghi
   ...
spec:
  container:
    image: gcr.io/...  # same container as previous revision abc
    env:
    - name: FOO
      value: bar
    - name: HELLO
      value: blurg # changed value
  ...
status:
  conditions:
   - type: Ready
     status: True
```

Even when ready, the new revision does not automatically start serving
traffic, as the route was pinned to revision `def`.

Update the route to make the existing revision serving traffic
addressable through subdomain `current`, and referencing the new
revision at 0% traffic but making it addressable through subdomain
`next`:

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - revisionName: def
      name: current  # addressable as current.my-service.default.mydomain.com
      percent: 100
    - revisionName: ghi
      name: next  # addressable as next.my-service.default.mydomain.com
      percent: 0 # no traffic yet
```

In this state, the route makes both revisions addressable with
subdomains `current` and `next` (once the revision `ghi` has a status of
Ready), but traffic has not shifted to next yet. Also note that while
the names current/next have semantic meaning, they are convention
only; blue/green, or any other subdomain names could be configured.

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  ...
spec:
  ... # unchanged
status:
  domain: my-service.default.mydomain.com
  traffic:
  - revisionName: def
    name: current  # addressable as current.my-service.default.mydomain.com
    percent: 100
  - revisionName: ghi
    name: next # addressable as next.my-service.default.mydomain.com
    percent: 0
  conditions:
  - type: RolloutComplete
    status: True
  ...
```

After testing the new revision at
`next.my-service.default.mydomain.com`, it can be rolled out to 100%
(either directly, or through several increments, with the split
totaling 100%):

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  rollout:
    Traffic: # percentages must total 100%
    - revisionName: def
      name: current
      percent: 0 
    - revisionName: ghi
      name: next
      percent: 100 # migrate traffic fully to the next revision
```

After reconciliation, all traffic has been shifted to the new version:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  ...
spec:
  ... # unchanged
status:
  domain: my-service.default.mydomain.com
  traffic:
  - revisionName: def
    name: current
    percent: 0
  - revisionName: ghi
    name: next
    percent: 100
  conditions:
  - type: RolloutComplete
    status: True
  ...
```

By convention, the final step when completing the rollout is to update
`current` to reflect the new revision. `next` can either be removed, or
left addressing the same revision as current so that
`next.my-service.default.mydomain.com` is always addressable.

```http
PATCH /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  rollout:
    traffic:
    - revisionName: ghi # update for the next rollout, current = next
      name: current
      percent: 100
    - revisionName: ghi # optional: leave next as also referring to ghi
      name: next
      percent: 0
```


## 4) Deploy a Revision from source

**Scenario**: User deploys a revision to an existing service from
  source rather than a pre-built container

```
$ elafros deploy --service my-service
  Deploying app to service [my-service]:
✓ Uploading     [=================] 
✓ Detected [node-8-9-4] runtime
✓ Building
✓ Starting
✓ Promoting
  Done.
  Deployed to https://my-service.default.mydomain.com
```

**Steps**:

* Create/Update a Configuration, inlining build details.

**Results**:

* The Configuration is created/updated, which generates a container
  build and a new revision based on the template, and can be rolled
  out per earlier examples

![Build Example](images/build_example.png)


Previous examples demonstrated configurations created with pre-built
containers. Revisions can also be created by providing build
information to the configuration, which results in a container image
built by the system. The build information is supplied by inlining the
BuildSpec of a Build resource in the Configuration. This describes:

* **What** to build (`build.source`): Source can be provided as an
  archive, manifest file, or repository.

* **How** to build (`build.template`): a
  [BuildTemplate](https://github.com/elafros/build) is referenced,
  which describes how to build the container via a builder with
  arguments to the build process.

* **Where** to publish (`build.template.arguments`): Image registry
  url and other information specific to this build invocation.

The client creates the configuration inlining a build spec for an
archive based source build, and referencing a nodejs build template:

```http
POST /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-service 
spec:
  build:  # build.dev/v1alpha1.BuildTemplateSpec
    source:
      # oneof git|gcs|custom:
      git:
        url: https://...
        commit: ...
    template:  # defines build template
      name: nodejs_8_9_4 # builder name
      namespace: build-templates
      arguments:
      - name: _IMAGE
        value: gcr.io/...  # destination for image

  revisionTemplate:  # template for building Revision
    metadata: ...
    spec:
      container:  # k8s core.v1.Container
        image: gcr.io/...  # Promise of a future build. Same as supplied in
                           # build.template.arguments[_IMAGE]
        env:  # Updated environment variables to go live with new source.
        - name: FOO
          value: bar
        - name: HELLO
          value: world
```

Note the `revisionTemplate.spec.container.image` above is supplied
with the destination of the build. This enables one-step changes to
both config and source code. If the build step were responsible for
updating the `revisionTemplate.spec.container.image` at the completion
of the build, an update to both source and config could result in the
creation of two Revisions, one with the config change, and the other
with the new code deployment. It is expected that Revision will wait
for the `buildName` to be complete and the
`revisionTemplate.spec.container.image` to be live before marking the
Revision as "ready".

Upon creating/updating the configuration's build field, the system
creates a new revision. The configuration controller will initiate a
build, populating the revision’s buildName with a reference to the
underlying Build resource. Via status updates which the revision
controller observes through the build reference, the high-level state
of the build is mirrored into conditions in the Revision’s status:

```http
GET /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/revisions/abc
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Revision
metadata:
  name: abc
  labels:
    elafros.dev/configuration: my-service
  annotations:
    elafros.dev/configurationGeneration: 1234
  ...
spec:
  # name of the build.dev/v1alpha1.Build, if built from source.
  # Set by Configuration.
  buildName: ...

  # spec from the configuration, with container.image containing the
  # newly built container
  container: # k8s core.v1.Container
    image: gcr.io/...
    env:
    - name: FOO
      value: bar
    - name: HELLO
      value: world
status:
  # This is a copy of metadata from the container image or grafeas, indicating
  # the provenance of the revision, annotated on the container
  imageSource:
    archive|manifest|repository: ...
    context: ...
  conditions:
  - type: Ready
    status: True
  - type: BuildComplete
    status: True
  # other conditions indicating build failure details, if applicable
```

Rollout operations in the route are identical to the pre-built
container examples.

Also analogous is updating the configuration to create a new
revision - in this case, updated source would be provided to the
configuration's inlined build spec, which would initiate a new
container build, and the creation of a new revision.


## 5) Deploy a Function

**Scenario**: User deploys a new function revision to an existing service

```
$ elafros deploy --function index --service my-function
  Deploying function to service [my-function]:
✓ Uploading     [=================] 
✓ Detected [node-8-9-4] runtime
✓ Building
✓ Starting
✓ Promoting
  Done.
  Deployed to https://my-function.default.mydomain.com
```

**Steps**:

* Create/Update a Configuration, additionally specifying function details.

**Results**:

* The Configuration is created/updated, which generates a new revision
  based on the template build and spec which can be rolled out per
  previous examples

![Build Function](images/build_function.png)


Previous examples illustrated creating and deploying revisions in the
context of apps.  Functions are created and deployed in the same
manner (in particular, as containers which respond to HTTP). In the
build phase of the deployment, additional function metadata may be
taken into account in order to wrap the supplied code in a functions
framework.

Functions are configured with a language-specific entryPoint. The
entryPoint may be provided as an argument to the build template, if
language-native autodetection is insufficient. By convention, a type
metadata label may also be added that designates revisions as a
function, supporting listing revisions by type; there is no change to
the system behavior based on type.

Note that a function may be connected to one or more event sources via
Bindings in the Eventing API; the binding of events to functions is
not a core function of the compute API.

Creating the configuration with build and function metadata:

```http
POST /apis/elafros.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/configurations
```
```yaml
apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Configuration
metadata:
  name: my-function 
spec:
  build:  # build.dev/v1alpha1.BuildTemplateSpec
    source:
      # oneof git|gcs|custom
      git:
        url: https://...
        commit: ...
    template:  # defines build template
      name: go_1_9_fn  # function builder
      namespace: build-templates
      arguments:
      - name: _IMAGE
        value: gcr.io/...  # destination for image
      - name: _ENTRY_POINT
        value: index  # language dependent, function-only entrypoint

  revisionTemplate:  # template for building Revision
    metadata:
      labels:
        # One-of "function" or "app", convention for CLI/UI clients to list/select
        elafros.dev/type: "function"
    spec:
      container:  # k8s core.v1.Container
        image: gcr.io/...  # Promise of a future build. Same as supplied in
                           # build.template.arguments[_IMAGE]
        env:
        - name: FOO
          value: bar
        - name: HELLO
          value: world
      
      # serializes requests for function. Default value for functions
      concurrencyModel: SingleThreaded
      # max time allowed to respond to request
      timeoutSeconds: 20
```

Upon creating or updating the configuration, a new Revision is created
per the previous examples. Rollout operations are also identical to
the previous examples.
