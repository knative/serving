# Resource Types

The primary resources in the Knative Serving API are Routes, Revisions,
Configurations, and Services:

* A **Route** provides a named endpoint and a mechanism for routing traffic to

* **Revisions**, which are immutable snapshots of code + config, created by a

* **Configuration**, which acts as a stream of environments for Revisions.

* **Service** acts as a top-level container for managing the set of
  Routes and Configurations which implement a network service.

## Route

**Route** provides a network endpoint for a user's service (which
consists of a series of software and configuration Revisions over
time). A kubernetes namespace can have multiple routes. The route
provides a long-lived, stable, named, HTTP-addressable endpoint that
is backed by one or more **Revisions**. The default configuration is
for the route to automatically route traffic to the latest revision
created by a **Configuration**. For more complex scenarios, the API
supports splitting traffic on a percentage basis, and CI tools could
maintain multiple configurations for a single route (e.g. "golden
path" and “experiments”) or reference multiple revisions directly to
pin revisions during an incremental rollout and n-way traffic
split. The route can optionally assign addressable subdomains to any
or all backing revisions.

## Revision

**Revision** is an immutable snapshot of code and configuration. A
revision references a container image, and optionally a build that is
responsible for materializing that container image from source.
Revisions are created by updates to a **Configuration**.

Revisions that are not addressable via a Route will be *retired*
and all underlying K8s resources will be deleted. This provides a
lightweight history of the revisions a configuration has produced
over time, and enables users to easily rollback to a prior revision.

Revisions that are addressable via a Route will have resource
utilization proportional to the load they are under.

## Configuration

A **Configuration** describes the desired latest Revision state, and
creates and tracks the status of Revisions as the desired state is
updated. A configuration might include instructions on how to transform
a source package (either git repo or archive) into a container by
referencing a [Build](https://github.com/knative/build), or might
simply reference a container image and associated execution metadata
needed by the Revision. On updates to a Configuration, a new build
and/or deployment (creating a Revision) may be performed; the
Configuration's controller will track the status of created Revisions
and makes both the most recently created and most recently *ready*
(i.e. healthy) Revision available in the status section.

## Service

A **Service** encapsulates a set of **Routes** and **Configurations**
which together provide a software component. Service exists to provide
a singular abstraction which can be access controlled, reasoned about,
and which encapsulates software lifecycle decisions such as rollout
policy and team resource ownership. Service acts only as an
orchestrator of the underlying Routes and Configurations (much as a
kubernetes Deployment orchestrates ReplicaSets), and its usage is
optional but recommended.

The Service's controller will track the statuses of its owned Configuration
and Route, reflecting their statuses and conditions as its own.

The owned Configurations' Ready conditions are surfaced as the Service's
ConfigurationsReady condition. The owned Routes' Ready conditions are
surfaced as the Service's RoutesReady condition.

## Orchestration

The system will be configured to disallow users from creating
([NYI](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/664)) or changing
Revisions. Instead, Revisions are created indirectly when a Configuration
is created or updated. This provides:

* a single referenceable resource for the route to perform automated
  rollouts
* a single resource that can be watched to see a history of all the
  revisions created
* PATCH semantics for revisions implemented server-side, minimizing
  read-modify-write implemented across multiple clients, which could result
  in optimistic concurrency errors
* the ability to rollback to a known good configuration

In the conventional single live revision scenario, a service creates
both a route and a configuration with the same name as the
service. Update operations on the service enable scenarios such
as:

* *"Push code, keep config":* Specifying a new revision with updated
  source, inheriting configuration such as env vars from the
  configuration.
* *"Update config, keep code"*: Specifying a new revision as just a
  change to configuration, such as updating an env variable,
  inheriting all other configuration and source/image.
* *"Execute a manual rollout"*: Updating the service when in pinned
  rollout mode allows manual testing of a revision before making it
  live.

Using a Service object to orchestrate the creation a both route and
configuration allows deployment of code (e.g. from a github button) to
avoid needing to reason about sequencing and failure modes of parallel
resource creation. The [sample API usage](normative_examples.md)
section illustrates conventional usage of the API.
