# Knative Serving API spec

This file contains the [resource paths](#resource-paths) and
[yaml schemas](#resource-yaml-definitions) that make up the Knative Serving API.

## Resource Paths

Resource paths in the Knative Serving API have the following standard k8s form:

```http
/apis/{apiGroup}/{apiVersion}/namespaces/{metadata.namespace}/{kind}/{metadata.name}
```

For example:

```http
/apis/serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1/namespaces/default/routes/my-service
```

It is expected that each Route will provide a name within a cluster-wide DNS
name. While no particular URL scheme is mandated (consult the `domain` property
of the Route for the authoritative mapping), a common implementation would be to
use the kubernetes namespace mechanism to produce a URL like the following:

```http
[$revisionname].$route.$namespace.<common knative cluster suffix>
```

For example:

```http
prod.my-service.default.mydomain.com
```

## Resource YAML Definitions

YAMLs for the Knative Serving API resources are described below, describing the
basic k8s structure: metadata, spec and status, along with comments on specific
fields.

### Route

For a high-level description of Routes, [see the overview](overview.md#route).

```yaml
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1alpha1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-service
  namespace: default
  labels:
    knative.dev/service: ...  # name of the Service automatically filled in

  # system generated meta
  uid: ...
  resourceVersion: ...  # used for optimistic concurrency control
  creationTimestamp: ...
  generation: ...  # updated only when spec changes; used by observedGeneration
  selfLink: ...
  ...
spec:
  traffic:
  # list of oneof configurationName | revisionName.
  #  configurationName watches configurations to address latest latestReadyRevisionName
  #  revisionName pins a specific revision
  - configurationName: ...
    name: ...  # +optional. Access as {name}.${status.domain},
               #  e.g. oss: current.my-service.default.mydomain.com
    percent: 100  # list percentages must add to 100. 0 is a valid list value
  - ...

status:
  # domain: The hostname used to access the default (traffic-split)
  #   route. Typically, this will be composed of the name and namespace
  #   along with a cluster-specific prefix (here, mydomain.com).
  domain: my-service.default.mydomain.com

  address: # knative/pkg/apis/duck/v1alpha1.Addressable
    # hostname: A DNS name for the default (traffic-split) route which can
    # be accessed without leaving the cluster environment.
    hostname: my-service.default.svc.cluster.local

  # DEPRECATED: see address.hostname (above)
  domainInternal: ...

  traffic:
  # current rollout status list. configurationName references
  #   are dereferenced to latest revision
  - revisionName: ...  # latestReadyRevisionName from a configurationName in spec

  # instance of the Revision container. A value of `2` or more will

## Container

This is a
[core.v1.Container](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.10/#container-v1-core).
Some fields are not allowed, such as name and volumeMounts.

This type is not used on its own but is found composed inside
[Service](#service), [Configuration](#configuration), and [Revision](#revision).

```yaml
container: # v1.Container
  # image either provided as pre-built container, or built by Knative Serving from
  # source. When built by knative, set to the same as build template, e.g.
  # build.template.arguments[_IMAGE], as the "promise" of a future build.
  # If buildRef is provided, it is expected that this image will be
  # present when the referenced build is complete.
  image: gcr.io/...
  command: ["run"]
  args: []
  env:
    # list of environment vars
    - name: FOO
      value: bar
    - name: HELLO
      value: world
    - ...

  # Optional, only a single containerPort may be specified.
  # This can be specified to select a specific port for incoming traffic.
  # This is useful if your application cannot discover the port to listen
  # on through the $PORT environment variable that is always set within the container.
  # Some fields are not allowed, such as hostIP and hostPort.
  ports: # core.v1.ContainerPort array
    # Valid range is [1-65535], except 8012 (RequestQueuePort)
    # and 8022 (RequestQueueAdminPort).
    - containerPort: ...
      name: ... # Optional, one of "http1", "h2c"
      protocol: ... # Optional, one of "", "tcp"

  # This specifies where the volumes present in the RevisionSpec will be mounted into
  # the container.  Each of the volumes in the ConfigurationSpec must be mounted here
  # or it is an error.
  volumeMounts:
  - name: ... # This must match a name from Volumes
    mountPath: ... # Where to mount the named Volume.
    readOnly: ... # Must be True, will default to True, so it may be omitted.
    # All other fields are disallowed.

  livenessProbe: ... # Optional
  readinessProbe: ... # Optional
  resources: ... # Optional
```
