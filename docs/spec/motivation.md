# Motivation

The goal of the Knative Serving project is to provide a common toolkit and API
framework for serverless workloads.

We define serverless workloads as computing workloads that are:

* Stateless
* Amenable to the process scale-out model
* Primarily driven by application level (L7 -- HTTP, for example)
  request traffic

While Kubernetes provides basic primitives like Deployment, and Service in
support of this model, our experience suggests that a more compact and richer
opinionated model has substantial benefit for developers. In particular, by
standardizing on higher-level primitives which perform substantial amounts of
automation of common infrastructure, it should be possible to build consistent
toolkits that provide a richer experience than updating yaml files with
`kubectl`.

The Knative Serving APIs consist of Compute API (these documents),
[Build API](https://github.com/knative/build) and
[Eventing API](https://github.com/knative/eventing).
