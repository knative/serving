# Elafros Developer Logging and Monitoring Contract

This documents the logging and monitoring capabilities and expectations about the
environment where Elafros [developers'](../product/personas.md#developer-personas)
applications, containers and functions run.

## Background

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT",
"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" are to be interpreted as
described in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).

## Logging

### User Logs

User logs are logs emitted from the applications, containers and functions. Elafros
generates a raw log record for each user log.

#### User Logs Locations

* `stdout` / `stderr`: Developer MUST be able to write logs to `stdout/stderr` channels.
* `/var/log`: Developer SHOULD be able to write logs to any file under `/var/log`
  if [cluster operator](../product/personas.md#operator-personas) enables this feature.

#### User Logs Formats

Logs are parsed line by line. If a single line message is a serialized JSON payload,
it SHOULD be treated as **structured** log and parsed accordingly. Otherwise it SHOULD
be treated as **plain text**.

For **plain text** logs, the original log message SHOULD be present as `log` field in
raw user log record.

For **structured** logs, all fields from the JSON payload SHOULD be added to the
raw user log record.

##### Multi-line

If the contents of `log` field in a consecutive sequence of raw user log records,
which from the same source, form an exception stack trace, these raw user log records
SHOULD be combined into one single user log record by taking the first log record
of the sequence and replacing the content of `log` field with the concatenated content
of all `log` fields in the sequence.

#### User Logs Metadata

The following metadata SHOULD be added to raw user log records:

* *kubernetes.labels.elafros_dev/configuration*: Name of Elafros configuration
  of the application, container or function that emitted the log.
* *kubernetes.labels.elafros_dev/revision*: Name of Elafros revision of the application,
  container or function that emitted the log.
* *kubernetes.namespace_name*: Name of Kubernetes Namespace of the application, container
  or function that emitted the log.
* *stream*: One of `stdout`, `stderr` or `varlog`.
* *file_path*: If the log was from `/var/log/*`, the value is the relative path to `/var/log/`.
  For example, the value of a log from `/var/log/foo/bar.log` is `foo/bar.log`. If
  the log was from other locations, the filed is absent.
* *time*: Time when the log was collected. **NOTE**: Developers need to add their own
  timestamp to the log if they want the timestamp to be accurate.

For example, a field `kubernetes.namespace_name` with value `default` means

```json
{
  "kubernetes": {
    "namespace_name": "default",
  }
}
```

### System Logs

#### Requests Logs

Status of requests or invocations sent to the applications, containers or functions
SHOULD be automatically collected as raw request log records.

##### Request Logs Metadata

The following metadata SHOULD be added to raw requests log records:

* *destinationConfiguration*: Name of Elafros Configuration that served the request.
* *destinationNamespace*: Name of Kubernetes Namespace that the request was served on.
* *destinationRevision*: Name of Elafros Revision that served the request.
* *latency*: Time with unit took for the request to complete.
* *method*: HTTP request method (GET, POST, etc).
* *protocol*: http, https or tcp.
* *referer*: Address of the previous web page from which the request was made.
* *requestHost*: Domain name of the service processing the request.
* *requestSize*: Size of the request.
* *responseCode*: HTTP response code.
* *responseSize*: Size of the response.
* *tag*: A fixed value set to “requestlog.logentry.istio-system” - used to identify request logs from other logs.
* *timestamp*: Time request was made.
* *traceId*: OpenTracing trace id.
* *url*: Relative URL that was requested.
* *userAgent*: User agent string of the request.

**NOTE**: There is no extra payload/message field.

### Log Destinations

Elafros MUST automatically perform log aggregation to the destination configured
by the [cluster operator](../product/personas.md#operator-personas). Operator
MUST document to developer how to access logs.

Depending on the log aggregation configuration, a final log entry visible to developer
MAY be different from its raw log record provided by Elafros.

### Log Cleanup

If a container is evicted from the node, all its log files SHOULD be garbage collected
at any point by Elafros.

Elafros MUST perform the rotation configured by the
[cluster operator](../product/personas.md#operator-personas) to the following log files:

  1. `stdout/stderr` log files(a single file per container generated by Kubernetes)
  2. log files under `/var/log/*`

## Monitoring

### Default Metrics

#### Revision Request Metrics

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **revision_request_count** | Counter | Number of times an application, a container or a function has been called since it was deployed. |
| **revision_request_duration** | Histogram | Time it took for an application, a container or a function to handle request. |
| **revision_request_size** | Histogram | Size of requests to an application, a container or a function. |
| **revision_response_size** | Histogram | Size of response from an application, a container or a function. |

The following metadata SHOULD be added to revision request metrics:

* *destination_configuration*: Name of Elafros Configuration that served the request.
* *destination_namespace*: Name of Kubernetes Namespace that the request was served on.
* *destination_revision*: Name of Elafros Revision that served the request.
* *response_code*: HTTP response code.
* *source_service*: If the request was from outside the cluster, this will be
  istio-ingress service name. If the request was from inside the cluster (revisions
  calling other revisions), this will be Kubernetes service name of the revision.

#### Container Metrics

| Name | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **container_memory_usage_bytes** | Gauge | Memory usage of a container. |
| **container_cpu_usage_seconds_total** | Counter | CPU usage of a container. |

The following metadata SHOULD be added to container metrics:

* *container_name*: Name of the container.
* *cpu*: CPU identification, cpu00, cpu01, etc.
* *namespace*: Name of Kubernetes Namespace that the container was served on.
* *pod_name*: Name of Kubernetes Pod that the container was served on.

### Metrics Destinations

Elafros MUST automatically perform metrics aggregation to the destination configured
by the [cluster operator](../product/personas.md#operator-personas). The destination
backend MUST be capable of handling metadata-keyed streams. Operator
MUST document to developer how to access metrics, as well as any dashboards provided.

## Distributed Tracing

Operators MAY choose to enable distributed tracing. If it is enabled, request traces
are automatically generated on behalf of the developer by [Istio](https://istio.io/).

### Traces Destinations

Elafros MUST automatically perform traces aggregation to the destination configured
by the [cluster operator](../product/personas.md#operator-personas). Operator
MUST document to developer how to access the traces.
