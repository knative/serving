  # AUTOSCALER CONFIGURATION

  # Static parameters:

  # The desired number of concurrent requests for each pod.  This
  # is the primary knob for the fast autoscaler which will try
  # achieve a 60-second average concurrency per pod of
  # targetConcurrency.  Another process may tune targetConcurrency
  # to best handle the resource requirements of the revision.
