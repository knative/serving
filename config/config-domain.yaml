    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # Default value for domain.
    # Although it will match all routes, it is the least-specific rule so it
    # will only be used if no other domain matches.
    example.com: |

    # These are example settings of domain.
    # example.org will be used for routes having app=nonprofit.

      selector:
        app: nonprofit
    
    # Routes having domain suffix of 'svc.cluster.local' will not be exposed
    # through Ingress. You can define your own label selector to assign that
    # domain suffix to your Route here, or you can set the label
    #    "serving.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local"
    # to achieve the same effect.  This shows how to make routes having
    # the label app=secret only exposed to the local cluster.
    svc.cluster.local: |
      selector:
        app: secret
