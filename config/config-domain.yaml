  # These are example settings of domain.

  #     app: prod

  # Default value for domain, for routes that does not have app=prod labels.
  # Although it will match all routes, it is the least-specific rule so it
  # will only be used if no other domain matches.

  # Routes having domain suffix of 'svc.cluster.local' will not be exposed
  # through Ingress. You can define your own label selector to assign that
  # domain suffix to your Route here, or you can set the label
  #    "serving.knative.dev/visibility=cluster-local"
  # to achieve the same effect.
