# The Gateway resource here is to attach to a gateway service that
# receive all external traffic for Knative pods. We don't maintain
# extra Gateway service and deployment in knative, but use that
# provided in Istio by default.

# If you want to replace the Gateway service and deployment to that
# of your own, you'll need to update the label selector and ports
# fields accordingly.

# This is the shared Gateway for all Knative routes to use.
