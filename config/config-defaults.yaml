    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # revision-timeout-seconds contains the default number of
    # seconds to use for the revision's per-request timeout, if
    # none is specified.
    revision-timeout-seconds: "300"  # 5 minutes

    # max-revision-timeout-seconds contains the maximum number of
    # seconds that can be used for revision-timeout-seconds.
    # This value must be greater than or equal to revision-timeout-seconds.
    # If omitted, the system default is used (600 seconds).
    max-revision-timeout-seconds: "600"  # 10 minutes

    # revision-cpu-request contains the cpu allocation to assign
    # to revisions by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    revision-cpu-request: "400m"  # 0.4 of a CPU (aka 400 milli-CPU)

    # revision-memory-request contains the memory allocation to assign
    # to revisions by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    revision-memory-request: "100M"  # 100 megabytes of memory

    # revision-cpu-limit contains the cpu allocation to limit

    # container-name-template contains a template for the default
    # container name, if none is specified.  This field supports

    # {{.Name}} are also valid.
