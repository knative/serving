    # This feature allows end-users to set a subset of fields on the Pod's SecurityContext
    # in addition to expanding the allowable fields within a Container's SecurityContext.
    #
    # When set to "enabled" or "allowed" it allows the following
    # PodSecurityContext properties:
    # - FSGroup
    # - RunAsGroup
    # - RunAsNonRoot
    # - SupplementalGroups
    # - RunAsUser
    #
    # When set to "enabled" or "allowed" it allows the following
    # Container SecurityContext properties:
    # - RunAsNonRoot
    # - RunAsGroup
    # - RunAsUser (already allowed without this flag)
    #
    # This feature flag should be used with caution as the PodSecurityContext
    # properties may have a side-effect on non-user sidecar containers that come
    # from Knative or your service mesh
    #
    # WARNING: Cannot safely be disabled once enabled.

    # This feature validates PodSpecs from the validating webhook
    # against the K8s API Server.
    #
    # When "enabled", the server will always run the extra validation.
    # When "allowed", the server will not run the dry-run validation by default.
    #   However, clients may enable the behavior on an individual Service by
    #   attaching the following metadata annotation: "features.knative.dev/podspec-dryrun":"enabled".
    # See: https://knative.dev/docs/serving/feature-flags/#kubernetes-dry-run
    kubernetes.podspec-dryrun: "allowed"

    # Indicates whether new responsive garbage collection is enabled. This
