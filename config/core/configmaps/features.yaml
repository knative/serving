    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # This feature validates PodSpecs from the validating webhook
    # against the K8s API Server.
    #
    # When "enabled", the server will always run the extra validation.
    # When "allowed", the server will not run the dry-run validation by default.
    #   However, clients may enable the behavior on an individual Service by
    #   attaching the following metadata annotation: "features.knative.dev/podspec-dryrun":"enabled".
    kubernetes.podspec-dryrun: "allowed"

    # Indicates whether new responsive garbage collection is enabled. This
    # feature labels revisions in real-time as they become referenced and
    # dereferenced by Routes. This allows us to reap revisions shortly after
    # they are no longer active.
    # ALPHA WARNING: This feature is not yet stable or complete. Enabling it
    # should be used for testing purposes only.
