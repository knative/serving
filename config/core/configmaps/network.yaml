    #    EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION     #
    #                              #
    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # istio.sidecar.includeOutboundIPRanges specifies the IP ranges that Istio sidecar
    # will intercept.
    #
    # Replace this with the IP ranges of your cluster (see below for some examples).
    # Separate multiple entries with a comma.
    # Example: "10.4.0.0/14,10.7.240.0/20"
    #
    # If set to "*" Istio will intercept all traffic within
    # the cluster as well as traffic that is going outside the cluster.
    # Traffic going outside the cluster will be blocked unless
    # necessary egress rules are created.
    #
    # If omitted or set to "", value of global.proxy.includeIPRanges
    # provided at Istio deployment time is used. In default Knative serving
    # deployment, global.proxy.includeIPRanges value is set to "*".
    #
    # If an invalid value is passed, "" is used instead.
    #
    # If valid set of IP address ranges are put into this value,
    # Istio will no longer intercept traffic going to IP addresses
    # outside the provided ranges and there is no need to specify
    # egress rules.
    #
    # To determine the IP ranges of your cluster:
    #   IBM Cloud Private: cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range
    #   IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: "172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24"
    #   Google Container Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters describe $CLUSTER_NAME --zone=$CLUSTER_ZONE | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr
    #   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): "10.0.0.0/16"
    #   Azure Container Service (ACS; deprecated): "10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16"
    #   Azure Container Service Engine (ACS-Engine; OSS): Configurable, but defaults to "10.0.0.0/16"
    #   Minikube: "10.0.0.1/24"

    # ingress.class specifies the default ingress class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Istio ingress.
    #
    # Note that changing the Ingress class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    ingress.class: "istio.ingress.networking.knative.dev"

    # certificate.class specifies the default Certificate class
    # to use when not dictated by Route annotation.
    #
    # If not specified, will use the Cert-Manager Certificate.
    #
    # Note that changing the Certificate class of an existing Route
    # will result in undefined behavior.  Therefore it is best to only
    # update this value during the setup of Knative, to avoid getting
    # undefined behavior.
    certificate.class: "cert-manager.certificate.networking.internal.knative.dev"

    # domainTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the Knative service's DNS name. The default
    # value is "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}". And those three
    # values (Name, Namespace, Domain) are the only variables defined.
    #
    # Changing this value might be necessary when the extra levels in
    # the domain name generated is problematic for wildcard certificates
    # that only support a single level of domain name added to the
    # certificate's domain. In those cases you might consider using a value
    # of "{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}", or removing the Namespace
    # entirely from the template. When choosing a new value be thoughtful
    # of the potential for conflicts - for example, when users choose to use
    # characters such as `-` in their service, or namespace, names.
    # {{.Annotations}} can be used for any customization in the go template if needed.
    # We strongly recommend keeping namespace part of the template to avoid domain name clashes
    # Example '{{.Name}}-{{.Namespace}}.{{ index .Annotations "sub"}}.{{.Domain}}'
    # and you have an annotation {"sub":"foo"}, then the generated template would be {Name}-{Namespace}.foo.{Domain}
    domainTemplate: "{{.Name}}.{{.Namespace}}.{{.Domain}}"

    # tagTemplate specifies the golang text template string to use
    # when constructing the DNS name for "tags" within the traffic blocks
    # of Routes and Configuration.  This is used in conjunction with the
    # domainTemplate above to determine the full URL for the tag.
    tagTemplate: "{{.Tag}}-{{.Name}}"

    # Controls whether TLS certificates are automatically provisioned and
    # installed in the Knative ingress to terminate external TLS connection.
    # 1. Enabled: enabling auto-TLS feature.
    # 2. Disabled: disabling auto-TLS feature.
    autoTLS: "Disabled"

    # Controls the behavior of the HTTP endpoint for the Knative ingress.
    # It requires autoTLS to be enabled.
    # 1. Enabled: The Knative ingress will be able to serve HTTP connection.
    # 2. Disabled: The Knative ingress will reject HTTP traffic.
    # 3. Redirected: The Knative ingress will send a 302 redirect for all
    # http connections, asking the clients to use HTTPS
    httpProtocol: "Enabled"
