    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # revision-timeout-seconds contains the default number of
    # seconds to use for the revision's per-request timeout, if
    # none is specified.
    revision-timeout-seconds: "300"  # 5 minutes

    # max-revision-timeout-seconds contains the maximum number of
    # seconds that can be used for revision-timeout-seconds.
    # This value must be greater than or equal to revision-timeout-seconds.
    # If omitted, the system default is used (600 seconds).
    #
    # If this value is increased, the activator's terminationGraceTimeSeconds
    # should also be increased to prevent in-flight requests being disrupted.
    max-revision-timeout-seconds: "600"  # 10 minutes

    # revision-cpu-request contains the cpu allocation to assign
    # to revisions by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    # Below is an example of setting revision-cpu-request.
    # By default, it is not set by Knative.
    revision-cpu-request: "400m"  # 0.4 of a CPU (aka 400 milli-CPU)

    # revision-memory-request contains the memory allocation to assign
    # to revisions by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    # Below is an example of setting revision-memory-request.
    # By default, it is not set by Knative.
    revision-memory-request: "100M"  # 100 megabytes of memory

    # revision-ephemeral-storage-request contains the ephemeral storage
    # allocation to assign to revisions by default.  If omitted, no value is
    # specified and the system default is used.
    revision-ephemeral-storage-request: "500M"  # 500 megabytes of storage

    # revision-cpu-limit contains the cpu allocation to limit
    # revisions to by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    # Below is an example of setting revision-cpu-limit.
    # By default, it is not set by Knative.
    revision-cpu-limit: "1000m"  # 1 CPU (aka 1000 milli-CPU)

    # revision-memory-limit contains the memory allocation to limit
    # revisions to by default.  If omitted, no value is specified
    # and the system default is used.
    # Below is an example of setting revision-memory-limit.
    # By default, it is not set by Knative.
    revision-memory-limit: "200M"  # 200 megabytes of memory

    # revision-ephemeral-storage-limit contains the ephemeral storage
    # allocation to limit revisions to by default.  If omitted, no value is
    # specified and the system default is used.
    revision-ephemeral-storage-limit: "750M"  # 750 megabytes of storage

    # container-name-template contains a template for the default
    # container name, if none is specified.  This field supports
    # Go templating and is supplied with the ObjectMeta of the
    # enclosing Service or Configuration, so values such as
    # {{.Name}} are also valid.
    container-name-template: "user-container"

    # container-concurrency specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once, and requests
    # above this threshold are queued.  Setting a value of zero
    # disables this throttling and lets through as many requests as
    # the pod receives.
    container-concurrency: "0"

    # The container concurrency max limit is an operator setting ensuring that
    # the individual revisions cannot have arbitrary large concurrency
    # values, or autoscaling targets. `container-concurrency` default setting
    # must be at or below this value.
    #
    # Must be greater than 1.
    #
    # Note: even with this set, a user can choose a containerConcurrency
    # of 0 (i.e. unbounded) unless allow-container-concurrency-zero is
    # set to "false".
    container-concurrency-max-limit: "1000"

    # allow-container-concurrency-zero controls whether users can
    # specify 0 (i.e. unbounded) for containerConcurrency.
    allow-container-concurrency-zero: "true"

    # enable-service-links specifies the default value used for the
    # enableServiceLinks field of the PodSpec, when it is omitted by the user.
    # See: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/connect-applications-service/#accessing-the-service
    #
    # In environments with large number of services it is suggested
    # to set this value to `false`.
    # See https://github.com/knative/serving/issues/8498.
    enable-service-links: "default"
