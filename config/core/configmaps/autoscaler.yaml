    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average.
    # Note: this limit will be applied to container concurrency set at every
    # level (ConfigMap, Revision Spec or Annotation).
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 â‡’ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.
    container-concurrency-target-percentage: "70"

    # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when concurrency is used as the scaling metric for a
    # Revision and the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
    # Even when specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
    # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    container-concurrency-target-default: "100"

    # The requests per second (RPS) target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when RPS is used as the scaling metric for a Revision and
    # the Revision specifies unlimited RPS. Even when specifying unlimited RPS,
    # the autoscaler will horizontally scale the application based on this
    # target RPS.
    # Must be greater than 1.0.
    # NOTE: Only one metric can be used for autoscaling a Revision.
    requests-per-second-target-default: "200"

    # The target burst capacity specifies the size of burst in concurrent
    # requests that the system operator expects the system will receive.
    # Autoscaler will try to protect the system from queueing by introducing
    # Activator in the request path if the current spare capacity of the
    # service is less than this setting.
    # If this setting is 0, then Activator will be in the request path only
    # when the revision is scaled to 0.
    # If this setting is > 0 and container-concurrency-target-percentage is
    # 100% or 1.0, then activator will always be in the request path.
    # -1 denotes unlimited target-burst-capacity and activator will always
    # be in the request path.
    # Other negative values are invalid.
    target-burst-capacity: "200"

    # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
    # average concurrency over the stable window.
    # Stable window must be in whole seconds.
    stable-window: "60s"

    # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches
    # panic-threshold-percentage the target concurrency, the autoscaler
    # enters panic mode. When operating in panic mode, the autoscaler
    # scales on the average concurrency over the panic window which is
    # panic-window-percentage of the stable-window.
    # When computing the panic window it will be rounded to the closest
    # whole second.
    panic-window-percentage: "10.0"

    # The percentage of the container concurrency target at which to
    # enter panic mode when reached within the panic window.
    panic-threshold-percentage: "200.0"

    # Max scale up rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
    # increase pod count. It is the maximum ratio of desired pods versus
    # observed pods.
    # Cannot less or equal to 1.
    # I.e with value of 2.0 the number of pods can at most go N to 2N
    # over single Autoscaler period (see tick-interval), but at least N to
    # N+1, if Autoscaler needs to scale up.
    max-scale-up-rate: "1000.0"

    # Max scale down rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
    # decrease pod count. It is the maximum ratio of observed pods versus
    # desired pods.
    # Cannot less or equal to 1.
    # I.e. with value of 2.0 the number of pods can at most go N to N/2
    # over single Autoscaler evaluation period (see tick-interval), but at
    # least N to N-1, if Autoscaler needs to scale down.
    # Not yet used // TODO(vagababov) remove once other parts are ready.
    max-scale-down-rate: "2.0"

    enable-scale-to-zero: "true"

    # Tick interval is the time between autoscaling calculations.
    tick-interval: "2s"

    # Dynamic parameters (take effect when config map is updated):

    # Scale to zero grace period is the time an inactive revision is left
    # running before it is scaled to zero (min: 30s).
