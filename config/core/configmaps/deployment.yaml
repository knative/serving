    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # List of repositories for which tag to digest resolving should be skipped
    registries-skipping-tag-resolving: "kind.local,ko.local,dev.local"

    # Maximum time allowed for an image's digests to be resolved.
    digest-resolution-timeout: "10s"

    # Duration we wait for the deployment to be ready before considering it failed.
    progress-deadline: "600s"

    # Sets the queue proxy's CPU request.
    # If omitted, a default value (currently "25m"), is used.
    queue-sidecar-cpu-request: "25m"

    # Sets the queue proxy's CPU limit.
    # If omitted, no value is specified and the system default is used.
    queue-sidecar-cpu-limit: "1000m"

    # Sets the queue proxy's memory request.
    # If omitted, no value is specified and the system default is used.
    queue-sidecar-memory-request: "400Mi"

    # Sets the queue proxy's memory limit.
    # If omitted, no value is specified and the system default is used.
    queue-sidecar-memory-limit: "800Mi"

    # Sets the queue proxy's ephemeral storage request.
    # If omitted, no value is specified and the system default is used.

    # The freezer service endpoint that queue-proxy calls when its traffic drops to zero or
    # scales up from zero.
    #
    # Freezer service is available at: https://github.com/knative-sandbox/container-freezer
    # or users may write their own service.
    #
    # The value will need to include both the host and the port that will be accessed.
    # For the host, $HOST_IP can be passed, and the appropriate host IP value will be swapped
    # in at runtime, which will enable the freezer daemonset to be reachable via the node IP.
    #
    # As an example:
    #     concurrency-state-endpoint: "http://$HOST_IP:9696"
    #
    # If not set, queue proxy takes no action (this is the default behavior).
    #
    # When enabled, a serviceAccountToken will be mounted to queue-proxy using
    # a projected volume. This requires the Service Account Token Volume Projection feature
    # to be enabled. For details, see this link:
    # https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#service-account-token-volume-projection
    #
    # NOTE THAT THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL / ALPHA FEATURE
