    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # Delay after revision creation before considering it for GC
    stale-revision-create-delay: "48h"

    # Duration since a route has pointed at the revision before it
    # should be GC'd.
    # This minus lastpinned-debounce must be longer than the controller
    # resync period (10 hours).
    stale-revision-timeout: "15h"

    # Minimum number of generations of non-active revisions to keep before
    # considering them for GC.
    stale-revision-minimum-generations: "20"

    # To avoid constant updates, we allow an existing annotation to be stale by this
    # amount before we update the timestamp.

    # V2 Garbage Collector Settings

    #
    # These settings are enabled via the 'responsive-revision-gc' feature flag.
    # ALPHA NOTE: This feature is still experimental and under active development.

    # Duration since revision creation before considering it for GC.
    retain-since-create-time: "48h"

    # Duration since a route has pointed at the revision
    # before considering it for GC.
    retain-since-last-active-time: "15h"

    # Minimum number of non-active revisions to retain.
    min-stale-revisions: "20"

    # Maximum number of non-active revisions to retain regardless of
    # creation or staleness time-bounds.
    #
    # Instead of allowing revisions to become stale down to min-stale-revisions,
    # this mode will keep around revisions up to this maximum limit. A value of 0
    # will immediately delete any non-active revisions. The expected total number
    # of revisions is the number of active plus this value.
    #
    # Set to -1 to disable this setting. Revisions will be eligible for gc as soon
    # as they are considered stale as long as there are more than min-stale-revisions.
