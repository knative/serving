    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # Delay after revision creation before considering it for GC
    stale-revision-create-delay: "48h"

    # Duration since a route has pointed at the revision before it
    # should be GC'd.
    # This minus lastpinned-debounce must be longer than the controller
    # resync period (10 hours).
    stale-revision-timeout: "15h"

    # Minimum number of generations of non-active revisions to keep before
    # considering them for GC.
    stale-revision-minimum-generations: "20"

    # To avoid constant updates, we allow an existing annotation to be stale by this
    # amount before we update the timestamp.

    # ---------------------------------------
    # V2 Garbage Collector Settings
    # ---------------------------------------
    #
    # These settings are enabled via the "responsive-revision-gc" feature flag.
    # ALPHA NOTE: This feature is still experimental and under active development.
    #
    # Stale
    #   * Revisions are considered stale if they were created after more than
    #      "retain-since-create-time" or last referenced by a route more than
    #      "retain-since-last-active-time" ago.
    #   * Either timeout may be set to "forever" to turn off time-based GC.
    # Active
    #   * Revisions which are referenced by a Route are considered active and
    #     are exempted from GC.
    #   * Individual revisions may be marked with the annotation
    #      "knative.dev/no-gc":"true" to be permanently considered active.
    #
    # Example config to immediately collect any inactive revision:
    #    min-stale-revisions: "0"
    #    retain-since-create-time: "0"
    #    retain-since-last-active-time: "0"
    #
    # Example config to always keep around the last ten revisions:
    #     retain-since-create-time: "disabled"
    #     max-non-active-revisions: "10"
    #
    # Example disable all GC:
    #     retain-since-create-time: "disabled"
    #     max-non-active-revisions: "disabled"
    #
    # Example config to keep recently deployed or active revisions,
    # always maintain the last two in case of rollback, and prevent
    # burst activity from exploding the count of old revisions:
    #      retain-since-create-time: "48h"
    #      retain-since-last-active-time: "15h"
    #      min-stale-revisions: "2"
    #      max-non-active-revisions: "1000"

    # Duration since creation before considering a revision for GC or "disabled".
    retain-since-create-time: "48h"

    # Duration since active before considering a revision for GC or "disabled".
    retain-since-last-active-time: "15h"

    # Minimum number of stale revisions to retain.
    min-stale-revisions: "20"

    # Maximum number of non-active revisions to retain.
    # Set to "disabled" to disable any maximum limit.
    max-non-active-revisions: "1000"
