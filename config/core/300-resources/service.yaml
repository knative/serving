                  A template for the current desired application state.
                  Changes to `template` will cause a new Revision to be created as
                  defined in the lifecycle section. The contents of the Service's
                  RevisionTemplateSpec is used to create a corresponding Configuration.

                  Traffic specifies how to distribute traffic over a
                  collection of Revisions belonging to the Service. If traffic is
                  empty or not provided, defaults to 100% traffic to the latest
                  `Ready` Revision. The contents of the Service's TrafficTarget is
                  used to create a corresponding Route.

                        of traffic.
                        This is mutually exclusive with configurationName.

                        this portion of traffic. When the "status.latestReadyRevisionName" of the
                        referenced configuration changes, we will automatically migrate traffic
                        from the prior "latest ready" revision to the new one.  This field is never
                        set in Route's status, only its spec.

                        that the latest ready Revision of the Configuration should be used
                        for this traffic target. When provided latestRevision MUST be true
                        if revisionName is empty, and it MUST be false when revisionName is non-empty.

                        Tag is optionally used to expose a dedicated URL for
                        referencing this target exclusively. The dedicated URL MUST include
                        in it the string provided by tag.
