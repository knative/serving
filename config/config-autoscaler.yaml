    #    EXAMPLE CONFIGURATION     #
    #                              #
    ################################

    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Revision ContainerConcurrency field specifies the maximum number
    # of requests the Container can handle at once. Container concurrency
    # target percentage is how much of that maximum to use in a stable
    # state. E.g. if a Revision specifies ContainerConcurrency of 10, then
    # the Autoscaler will try to maintain 7 concurrent connections per pod
    # on average. A value of 70 is chosen because the Autoscaler panics
    # when concurrency exceeds 2x the desired set point. So we will panic
    # before we reach the limit.
    # For legacy and backwards compatibility reasons, this value also accepts
    # fractional values in (0, 1] interval (i.e. 0.7 ⇒ 70%).
    # Thus minimal percentage value must be greater than 1.0, or it will be
    # treated as a fraction.
    # TODO(#2016): Set to 70%.
    container-concurrency-target-percentage: "100"

    # The container concurrency target default is what the Autoscaler will
    # try to maintain when the Revision specifies unlimited concurrency.
    # Even when specifying unlimited concurrency, the autoscaler will
    # horizontally scale the application based on this target concurrency.
    #
    # A value of 100 is chosen because it's enough to allow vertical pod
    # autoscaling to tune resource requests. E.g. maintaining 1 concurrent
    # "hello world" request doesn't consume enough resources to allow VPA
    # to achieve efficient resource usage (VPA CPU minimum is 300m).
    container-concurrency-target-default: "100"

    # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
    # average concurrency over the stable window.
    stable-window: "60s"

    # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches
    # panic-threshold-percentage the target concurrency, the autoscaler
    # enters panic mode. When operating in panic mode, the autoscaler
    # scales on the average concurrency over the panic window which is
    # panic-window-percentage of the stable-window.
    panic-window-percentage: "10.0"

    # Absolute panic window duration.
    # Deprecated in favor of panic-window-percentage.
    # Existing revisions will continue to scale based on panic-window
    # but new revisions will default to panic-window-percentage.
    panic-window: "6s"

    # The percentage of the container concurrency target at which to
    # enter panic mode when reached within the panic window.
    panic-threshold-percentage: "200.0"

    # Max scale up rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
    # increase pod count. It is the maximum ratio of desired pods versus
    # observed pods.

    # Scale to zero feature flag
    enable-scale-to-zero: "true"

    # Tick interval is the time between autoscaling calculations.

    # Dynamic parameters (take effect when config map is updated):

    # Scale to zero grace period is the time an inactive revision is left
    # running before it is scaled to zero (min: 30s).
