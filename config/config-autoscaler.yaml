  # Static parameters:

  # Target concurrency is the desired number of concurrent requests for
  # each pod. This is the primary knob for fast autoscaling which will
  # try achieve an concurrency per pod of the target
  # concurrency. Single-concurrency must target a value close to 1.0.
  multi-concurrency-target: "1.0"
  single-concurrency-target: "0.9"

  # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
  # average concurrency over the stable window.
  stable-window: "60s"

  # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches 2x
  # the target concurrency, the autoscaler enters panic mode. When
  # operating in panic mode, the autoscaler operates on the average
  # concurrency over the panic window.
  panic-window: "6s"

  # Max scale up rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
  # increase pod count. It is the maximum ratio of desired pods versus
  # observed pods.
  max-scale-up-rate: "10"

  # Concurrency quantum of time is the minimum time is the quantum in
  # which concurrency will be measured by the queue-proxy.
  # The maximum concurrency in each of the "buckets" (of the duration
  # defined here) is taken and the average over all buckets is
  # reported.
  concurrency-quantum-of-time: "100ms"

  # Scale to zero feature flag
  enable-scale-to-zero: "true"

  # Experimental: enable vertical pod autoscaling.
  # Requires a VPA installation (e.g. ./third_party/vpa/install-vpa.sh)
  enable-vertical-pod-autoscaling: "false"
  #
  # This will be the multi-concurrency-target when
  # enable-vertical-pod-autoscaling is true. And it will be the new
  # default when the experiment is launched and removed.
  vpa-multi-concurrency-target: "10.0"

  # Tick interval is the time between autoscaling calculations.
  tick-interval: "2s"
  
  # Dynamic parameters (take effect when config map is updated):

  # Scale to zero threshold is the time a revision must be idle before
  # it is scaled to zero.
