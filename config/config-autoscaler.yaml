  # Static parameters:

  # Target concurrency is the desired number of concurrent requests for
  # each pod. This is the primary knob for fast autoscaling which will
  # try achieve an concurrency per pod of the target
  # concurrency. Single-concurrency must target a value close to 1.0.
  multi-concurrency-target: "1.0"
  single-concurrency-target: "0.9"

  # When operating in a stable mode, the autoscaler operates on the
  # average concurrency over the stable window.
  stable-window: "60s"

  # When observed average concurrency during the panic window reaches 2x
  # the target concurrency, the autoscaler enters panic mode. When
  # operating in panic mode, the autoscaler operates on the average
  # concurrency over the panic window.
  panic-window: "6s"

  # Max scale up rate limits the rate at which the autoscaler will
  # increase pod count. It is the maximum ratio of desired pods versus
  # observed pods.
  max-scale-up-rate: "10"

  # Concurrency quantum of time is the minimum time a request consumes
  # for the purpose of reporting concurrency metrics. The number of
  # quantums of time that fit into 1 second determines the max QPS the
  # pod will handle. Requests can span multiple quantums of time in
  # which case the request duration is rounded up.
  concurrency-quantum-of-time: "100ms"

  # Scale to zero feature flag
  enable-scale-to-zero: "false"

  # Dynamic parameters (take effect when config map is updated):

  # Scale to zero threshold is the time a revision must be idle before
  # it is scaled to zero.
  scale-to-zero-threshold: "5m"
