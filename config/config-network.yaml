  # Specifies the IP ranges that Istio sidecar will intercept.
  # Replace this with the IP ranges of your cluster (see below for some examples).
  # Separate multiple entries with a comma.
  # Example: "10.4.0.0/14,10.7.240.0/20"
  # 
  # If set to "*" Istio will intercept all traffic within
  # the cluster as well as traffic that is going outside the cluster.
  # Traffic going outside the cluster will be blocked unless
  # necessary egress rules are created. 
  #
  # If omitted or set to "", value of global.proxy.includeIPRanges
  # provided at Istio deployment time is used. In default Knative serving
  # deployment, global.proxy.includeIPRanges value is set to "*".
  # 
  # If an invalid value is passed, "" is used instead.
  # 
  # If valid set of IP address ranges are put into this value,
  # Istio will no longer intercept traffic going to IP addresses
  # outside the provided ranges and there is no need to specify
  # egress rules.
  # 
  # To determine the IP ranges of your cluster:
  #   IBM Cloud Private: cat cluster/config.yaml | grep service_cluster_ip_range
  #   IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: "172.30.0.0/16,172.20.0.0/16,10.10.10.0/24"
  #   Google Container Engine (GKE): gcloud container clusters describe XXXXXXX --zone=XXXXXX | grep -e clusterIpv4Cidr -e servicesIpv4Cidr
  #   Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS): "10.0.0.0/16"
  #   Azure Container Service (ACS; deprecated): "10.244.0.0/16,10.240.0.0/16"
  #   Azure Container Service Engine (ACS-Engine; OSS): Configurable, but defaults to "10.0.0.0/16"
  #   Minikube: "10.0.0.1/24"
