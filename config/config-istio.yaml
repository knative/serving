    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # Default Knative Gateway after v0.3. It points to the Istio
    # standard istio-ingressgateway, instead of a custom one that we
    # used pre-0.3. The configuration format should be `gateway.
    # {{gateway_namespace}}.{{gateway_name}}: "{{ingress_name}}.
    # {{ingress_namespace}}.svc.cluster.local"`. The {{gateway_namespace}}
    # is optional; when it is omitted, the system will search for
    # the gateway in the serving system namespace `knative-serving`

    # A cluster local gateway to allow pods outside of the mesh to access
    # Services and Routes not exposing through an ingress.  If the users
    # do have a service mesh setup, this isn't required and can be removed.
    #
    # An example use case is when users want to use Istio without any
    # sidecar injection (like Knative's istio-lean.yaml).  Since every pod
    # is outside of the service mesh in that case, a cluster-local  service
    # will need to be exposed to a cluster-local gateway to be accessible.
    # The configuration format should be `local-gateway.{{local_gateway_namespace}}.
    # {{local_gateway_name}}: "{{cluster_local_gateway_name}}.
    # {{cluster_local_gateway_namespace}}.svc.cluster.local"`. The
    # {{local_gateway_namespace}} is optional; when it is omitted, the system
    # will search for the local gateway in the serving system namespace
    # `knative-serving`
    local-gateway.knative-serving.cluster-local-gateway: "cluster-local-gateway.istio-system.svc.cluster.local"

    # To use only Istio service mesh and no cluster-local-gateway, replace
