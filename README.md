Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes to support deploying and serving of
applications and functions as serverless containers. Serving is easy to get
started with and scales to support advanced scenarios.

The Knative Serving project provides middleware primitives that enable:

- Rapid deployment of serverless containers
- Automatic scaling up and down to zero
- Routing and network programming
- Point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations
