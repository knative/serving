Knative Serving builds on Kubernetes and Istio to support deploying and serving
of serverless applications and functions. Serving is easy to get started with
and scales to support advanced scenarios.

The Knative Serving project provides middleware primitives that enable:

- Rapid deployment of serverless containers
- Automatic scaling up and down to zero
- Routing and network programming for Istio components
- Point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations
