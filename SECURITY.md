# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We (the community) support the most recent 4 minor versions of Knative. For more
details on what this means, see our
[release principles](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/mechanics/release-versioning-principles/).

The most release releases are listed
[here](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email the [Knative Steering Committee](mailto:knative-steering@googlegroups.com) with confidential security
reports. Someone on the committee, or a delegate, will get back to you within 3 business days. Accepted reports
that are kept confidential will be fixed within 90 days via a minor or patch release for supported minor versions.

Some vulnerabilities may be eligible for rewards through [Google's
VRP](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html) or similar programs from other vendors.
Reporters should comply with program rules to receive these rewards; the Knative community will not submit reports
for rewards on the reporter's behalf.
