# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We (the community) support the most recent 4 minor versions of Knative. For more
details on what this means, see our
[release principles](https://knative.dev/community/contributing/mechanics/release-versioning-principles/).

Releases are listed
[here](https://github.com/knative/serving/releases).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email the
[Knative Steering Committee](mailto:knative-security@googlegroups.com) with
confidential security reports. Someone will get
back to you within 3 business days. Accepted reports that are kept confidential
will be fixed within 90 days via a minor or patch release for supported minor
versions.

Some vulnerabilities may be eligible for rewards through
[Google's VRP](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/index.html)
or similar programs from other vendors. Reporters should comply with program
rules to receive these rewards; the Knative community will not submit reports
for rewards on the reporter's behalf.
