# Duty

Every week we dedicate one individual (the community contact) to watch for user
issues and either answer them or redirect the questions to other who can. The
community contact's duty (subject to change) is as followed:

## Daily check list

* Check the knative-users@ mailing list for new unanswered questions.
* Check [unassigned issues / untriaged
  issues](https://github.com/knative/serving/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+no%3Aassignee+no%3Amilestone)
  for unanswered questions.
* Join conversations that @serving-help is tagged.

## Weekly check list

### Monday
Check the [Serving test grid](https://testgrid.knative.dev/serving) for
flakiness to pick a test and focus on fixing it during your week.

Once you pick the test flake, assign the corresponding bug filed by flakiness
test reporter to yourself so that others won't pick the same test to fix.

### Tuesday - Thursday

Continue on fixing test flakes and answer

### Friday

* Remove yourself from @serving-help usergroup and add the next contact. If you
  don't have permission, ask in the Slack channel #steering-toc-questions.
* Email the next contacts, cc'ing knative-dev@ with a short summaries of the
  user questions encountered and links to them.
* File issue or document suggested improvements to this process.


## SLO

Participation is voluntary and based on good faith. We are only expected to
participate during our local office hour.

# Roster

We seed this rotation with all approvers from all the Serving workgroups,
excluding productivity. If you are no longer active in Knative, or if you are
contributing on personal capacity and do not have time to contribute in the
rotation, feel free to send a PR to remove yourself.
