# Duty

Every week we dedicate one individual (the community contact) to watch for user
issues and either answer them or redirect the questions to other who can. The
community contact's duty (subject to change) is as followed:

### All days

- Check the [Serving test grid](https://testgrid.knative.dev/serving) for
  flakiness to pick a test and focus on fixing it during your week. Once you
  pick the test flake, assign the corresponding bug filed by flakiness test
  reporter to yourself so that others won't pick the same test to fix.

  [knative-users@](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/knative-users)
  mailing list.
- Add your self as a member of Slack user group `@serving-help`

  [#serving-questions](https://knative.slack.com/archives/C0186KU7STW) for
