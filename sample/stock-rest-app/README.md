# Stock

A simple Restful service for testing purpose. It expose an endpoint, which takes
a stock ticker (stock symbol) and output the stock price. It uses the the REST resource
name from environment defined in configuration.

## Prerequisites

1. [Setup your development environment](../../DEVELOPMENT.md#getting-started)
2. [Start Elafros](../../README.md#start-elafros)

## Running

You can deploy this to Elafros from the root directory via:
```shell
 bazel run sample/stock-rest-app:everything.create
```

Once deployed, you can inspect the created resources with `kubectl` commands:

```shell
# This will show the route that we created:
kubectl get route -o yaml
```

```shell
# This will show the configuration that we created:
kubectl get configurations -o yaml
```

```shell
# This will show the Revision that was created by our configuration:
kubectl get revisions -o yaml

```

To access this service via `curl`, we first need to determine its ingress address:
```shell
watch kubectl get ingress
```

When the ingress is ready, you'll see an IP address in the ADDRESS field:

```
NAME                                 HOSTS                     ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
stock-route-example-ela-ingress   stock-route-example.default.demo-domain.com   35.185.44.102   80        1m
```

Once the `ADDRESS` gets assigned to the cluster, you can run:

```shell
# Put the Ingress Host name into an environment variable.
export SERVICE_HOST=`kubectl get route stock-route-example -o jsonpath="{.status.domain}"`

# Put the Ingress IP into an environment variable.
export SERVICE_IP=`kubectl get ingress stock-route-example-ela-ingress -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*]['ip']}"`
```

If your cluster is running outside a cloud provider (for example on Minikube),
your ingress will never get an address. In that case, use the istio `hostIP` and `nodePort` as the service IP:

```shell
export SERVICE_IP=$(kubectl get po -l istio=ingress -n istio-system -o 'jsonpath={.items[0].status.hostIP}'):$(kubectl get svc istio-ingress -n istio-system -o 'jsonpath={.spec.ports[?(@.port==80)].nodePort}')
```

Now curl the service IP as if DNS were properly configured:

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}
# Welcome to the stock app!
```

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}/stock
# stock ticker not found!, require /stock/{ticker}
```

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}/stock/<ticker>
# stock price for ticker <ticker>  is  <price>
```

## Updating

You can update this to a new version. For example, update it with a new configuration.yaml via:
```shell
bazel run sample/stock-rest-app:updated_everything.apply
```

Once deployed, traffic will shift to the new revision automatically. You can verify the new version
by checking route status:
```shell
# This will show the route that we created:
kubectl get route -o yaml
```

Or curling the service:

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}
# Welcome to the share app!
```

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}/share
# share ticker not found!, require /share/{ticker}
```

```shell
curl --header "Host:$SERVICE_HOST" http://${SERVICE_IP}/share/<ticker>
# share price for ticker <ticker>  is  <price>
```

## Manual traffic splitting

You can manually split traffic to specific revisions. Get your revisions names via:
```shell

kubectl get revisions
```

```
NAME                                AGE
stock-configuration-example-00001   11m
stock-configuration-example-00002   4m
```

Update `traffic` part in sample/stock-rest-app/route.yaml as:
```yaml
traffic:
  - revisionName: <YOUR_FIRST_REVISION_NAME>
    percent: 50
  - revisionName: <YOUR_SECOND_REVISION_NAME>
    percent: 50
```

Then update your change via:
```shell
bazel run sample/stock-rest-app:everything.apply
```

Once updated, you can verify the traffic splitting by looking at route status and/or curling
the service.

## Cleaning up

To clean up the sample service:

```shell
bazel run sample/stock-rest-app:everything.delete
```
