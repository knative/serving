# Tic Tac Toe in K-Dimensions

This is a fork of https://github.com/josephburnett/kdt3, modified to load a static game from Google Cloud Storage.

It represents a typical serverless workload which:
1. loads some data from storage,
2. does a little computation and
3. renders an HTML page from a template.
