# Buildpack Sample App

A sample app that demonstrates usage of Cloud Foundry buildpacks on Elafros,
using the [packs Docker images](https://github.com/sclevine/packs).

This deploys the [.NET Core Hello World](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/dotnet-core-hello-world)
sample app for Cloud Foundry.

## Prerequisites

1. [Setup your development environment](../../DEVELOPMENT.md#getting-started)
2. [Start Elafros](../../README.md#start-elafros)
3. Enable the Google Cloud Datastore API.

## Running

You can deploy this to Elafros from the root directory via:
```shell
$ bazel run sample/buildpack-app:everything.create
...
buildtemplate "buildpack" created
route "buildpack-sample-app" created
configuration "buildpack-sample-app" created
```

Once deployed, you will see that it first builds:

```shell
$ kubectl get revision -o yaml
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: elafros.dev/v1alpha1
  kind: Revision
  ...
  status:
    conditions:
    - reason: Building
      status: "False"
      type: BuildComplete
...
```

Once the `BuildComplete` status becomes `True` the resources will start getting created.


To access this service via `curl`, we first need to determine its ingress address:
```shell
$ watch kubectl get ing
NAME                             HOSTS                          ADDRESS    PORTS     AGE
buildpack-sample-app-ela-ingress buildpack-app.example.com                 80        3m
```

Once the `ADDRESS` gets assigned to the cluster, you can run:

```shell
# Put the Ingress IP into an environment variable.
$ export SERVICE_IP=`kubectl get ingress buildpack-sample-app-ela-ingress -o jsonpath="{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[*]['ip']}"`

# Curl the Ingress IP "as-if" DNS were properly configured.
$ curl --header 'Host: buildpack-app.example.com' http://${SERVICE_IP}/
[response]
```

## Cleaning up

To clean up the sample service:

```shell
bazel run sample/buildpack-app:everything.delete
```
