# Helper scripts

This directory contains helper scripts used by Prow test jobs, as well and local development scripts.

It lives in the `knative/test-infra` repository, and is exported to all other Knative repositories through the `git subtree split` branch `exported-scripts`, and usually lives in `test/scripts` in these repos.
