# This script runs the end-to-end tests against Knative Serving built from source.
# It is started by prow for each PR. For convenience, it can also be executed manually.

# If you already have the *_OVERRIDE environment variables set, call
# this script with the --run-tests arguments and it will start knative in
# the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start knative in it, run the tests and delete the
# cluster.

# You can specify the version to run against with the --version argument
# (e.g. --version v0.7.0). If this argument is not specified, the script will
# run against the latest tagged version on the current branch.
