# This script runs the end-to-end tests against Knative Serving built from source.
# It is started by prow for each PR. For convenience, it can also be executed manually.

# If you already have the *_OVERRIDE environment variables set, call
# this script with the --run-tests arguments and it will start knative in
# the cluster and run the tests.

# Calling this script without arguments will create a new cluster in
# project $PROJECT_ID, start knative in it, run the tests and delete the
# cluster.

# Latest serving release. This is intentionally hardcoded so that we can test
# upgrade/downgrade on release branches (or even arbitrary commits).
#
# Unfortunately, that means we'll need to manually bump this version when we
# make new releases.
#
# Fortunately, that's not *too* terrible, because forgetting to bump this
# version will make tests either:
# 1. Still pass, meaning we can upgrade from earlier than latest release (good).
# 2. Fail, which might be remedied by bumping this version.
