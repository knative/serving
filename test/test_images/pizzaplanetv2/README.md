# Conformance test image (v2)

This directory contains a test image used in the conformance tests.

The images contain a webserver that will by default listens on port `8080` and
expose a service at `/`.

When called, the server emits the message "Re-energize yourself with a slice of
pepperoni!".

## Building

For details about building and adding new images, see the
