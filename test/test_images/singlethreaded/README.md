# Conformance test image (single threaded)

This directory contains a test image used in the conformance tests.

The images contain a webserver that will by default listens on port
`8080` and expose a service at `/`.

When called, the server sleeps a short period and returns a 200 status
if no other request is running in the container concurrently. If it
does detect concurrent requests, it instead returns a 500 status.

## Building

For details about building and adding new images, see the [section about test
images](/test/README.md#test-images).
