# Helloworld test image

This directory contains the test image used in the envvars e2e test.

The image contains a simple Go webserver, `envvars.go`, that will, by default,
listen on port `8080` and expose a service at `/`.

When called, the server emits a message containing the values of the environment
variables for knative service, configuraiton and revision.
