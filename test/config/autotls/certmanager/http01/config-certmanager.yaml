    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this block and unindented to actually change the configuration.

    # issuerRef is a reference to the issuer for this certificate.
    # IssuerRef should be either `ClusterIssuer` or `Issuer`.
    # Please refer `IssuerRef` in https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/blob/master/pkg/apis/certmanager/v1alpha1/types_certificate.go
    # for more details about IssuerRef configuration.
