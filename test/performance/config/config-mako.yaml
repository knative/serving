    # This block is not actually functional configuration,
    # but serves to illustrate the available configuration
    # options and document them in a way that is accessible
    # to users that `kubectl edit` this config map.
    #
    # These sample configuration options may be copied out of
    # this example block and unindented to be in the data block
    # to actually change the configuration.

    # The Mako environment in which we are running.
    # Only our performance automation should run in "prod", but
    # there should be a "dev" environment with a fairly broad
    # write ACL.  Users can also develop against custom configurations
    # by adding `foo.config` under their benchmark's kodata directory.
