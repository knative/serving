# Re-create Serving Components

This directory contains all the files needed to re-create all the benchmarking
clusters. It contains of

- recreate.yaml: Cron job that runs once a day. This will run the script
  recreate.sh
- recreate.sh: This will:
  - Read all the current clusters in the `knative-performance` project
  - Kill all the current K8S objects
  - Delete the existing cluster
  - Recreate the cluster with the same name, node-count and in the same zone
  - Install knative serving at HEAD
  - Apply patches to setup performance testing
  - Run `ko apply` to all objects in the test-dir. Note that, this assuumes that
    the dir name and cluster name are the same.
- recreate-test.yaml: K8S Job to make sure `recreate.sh` works as expected
