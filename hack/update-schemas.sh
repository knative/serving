# Install patched schemagen into a temporary directory.
#
# We need a patched version because
# 1. There's a bug that makes our URL types unusable
#    see https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-tools/issues/560
# 2. We need specialized logic to filter down the surface of PodSpec we allow in Knative.
#    The respective config for this is in `schemapatch-config.yaml`
